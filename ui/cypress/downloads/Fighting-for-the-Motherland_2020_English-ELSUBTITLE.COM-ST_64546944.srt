1
00:00:38,919 --> 00:00:40,561
In bygone years,

2
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:43,362
leading armed cavaliers,
with golden spear in hand,

3
00:00:43,764 --> 00:00:46,927
tigerlike, I had slain the foe on
the thousand-mile Central Plain.

4
00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:50,129
Grandpa

5
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:51,692
gave the sword to me

6
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:54,535
on Mount Tai.

7
00:00:56,336 --> 00:00:57,377
Since then,

8
00:00:57,978 --> 00:01:00,661
I've taken it to every battlefield

9
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:02,942
and never been anywhere without it.

10
00:01:05,546 --> 00:01:06,907
Grandpa asked me

11
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,550
to come here again

12
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,112
and tell him about it

13
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:14,875
when the lost land is recovered

14
00:01:15,516 --> 00:01:17,678
from the Jin Dynasty someday.

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,642
This sword

16
00:01:22,763 --> 00:01:24,084
is called.

17
00:01:25,205 --> 00:01:26,286
"Guangfu".

18
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:33,413
"Recover lost land

19
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:37,457
for China's reunification."

20
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,703
In the 32nd year (1162) during the reign of Emperor
Gaozong of the Southern Song Dynasty, Wanyan Liang,

21
00:01:50,727 --> 00:01:52,478
emperor of the Jurchen-led Jin Dynasty, assembled
his troops and tried to conquer southern China.

22
00:01:52,502 --> 00:01:55,379
As they implemented a harsh recruitment
policy in the Central Plain, the

23
00:01:55,403 --> 00:01:58,263
masses found it hard to live on, so
they rose up in arms in succession…

24
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:04,003
Sifengzha Village.

25
00:03:11,671 --> 00:03:12,671
Shuanghua.

26
00:03:14,114 --> 00:03:15,114
Shuanghua.

27
00:03:23,644 --> 00:03:24,644
Shuanghua!

28
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:51,928
Langtou.

29
00:03:51,952 --> 00:03:52,952
Here!

30
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,436
Bro.

31
00:03:58,398 --> 00:03:59,398
Where are the others?

32
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,960
They're dead.

33
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:02,401
All of them.

34
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:22,743
Where is Shuanghua?

35
00:04:22,823 --> 00:04:23,823
She…

36
00:04:24,945 --> 00:04:26,266
I don't know.

37
00:04:26,707 --> 00:04:28,188
I asked you to look after her.

38
00:04:28,628 --> 00:04:29,628
Bro.

39
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,471
There are way too many Jin soldiers.

40
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,714
I failed to defend it.

41
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:37,476
You can leave.

42
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:38,919
I want to follow you.

43
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:40,239
Go away!

44
00:04:57,617 --> 00:04:58,617
Don't cry.

45
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:00,379
Don't give them a chance to laugh at us.

46
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:01,941
Shuanghua.

47
00:05:02,022 --> 00:05:03,599
I'm scared.

48
00:05:03,623 --> 00:05:04,623
Don't be afraid.

49
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:06,185
I'm here with you.

50
00:05:07,427 --> 00:05:09,525
No. Don't kill my elder sister.

51
00:05:09,549 --> 00:05:09,990
I beg you.

52
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,070
Wait.

53
00:05:24,885 --> 00:05:26,446
Don't kill my elder sister. Please.

54
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,852
What's your name?

55
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:41,581
Shuanghua.

56
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:42,518
Liang.

57
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,542
Shuanghua.

58
00:05:44,464 --> 00:05:45,282
You brute!

59
00:05:45,306 --> 00:05:47,347
You assholes!

60
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,510
Shuanghua.

61
00:06:00,881 --> 00:06:01,881
Shuanghua.

62
00:06:02,202 --> 00:06:03,403
Shuanghua!

63
00:06:06,606 --> 00:06:07,848
Shuanghua!

64
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:12,652
Shuanghua.

65
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:14,133
You asshole!

66
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,656
You assholes!

67
00:06:21,101 --> 00:06:22,342
Shuanghua!

68
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,426
You brute!

69
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,141
Let's fight to the end!

70
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:08,548
Shuanghua, are you okay?

71
00:07:18,358 --> 00:07:19,358
Go save the others.

72
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,841
Xin Qiji.

73
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:23,403
Hurba!

74
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:54,194
Liang.

75
00:07:54,594 --> 00:07:55,594
Shuanghua.

76
00:07:56,156 --> 00:07:57,156
Hide yourself.

77
00:08:57,697 --> 00:08:58,697
Shuanghua.

78
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:06,987
Liang.

79
00:09:07,507 --> 00:09:08,507
Liang.

80
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:09,949
Liang.

81
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:16,636
I want to go home.

82
00:09:21,441 --> 00:09:22,562
Liang.

83
00:09:24,284 --> 00:09:25,485
Liang.

84
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,092
Liang.

85
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:45,824
Liang,

86
00:09:46,626 --> 00:09:47,626
trust me.

87
00:09:49,109 --> 00:09:50,910
I'll avenge your death.

88
00:09:51,231 --> 00:09:52,231
Bro,

89
00:09:53,473 --> 00:09:55,195
now we're homeless.

90
00:09:56,316 --> 00:09:57,597
We'll have a new home

91
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,237
when we drive the Jurchen away.

92
00:10:44,404 --> 00:10:45,404
Bro,

93
00:10:46,126 --> 00:10:47,487
where are you going next?

94
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:49,488
Tai'an.

95
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,731
We'll go to Tai'an City.

96
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:54,094
I swear I'd do everything I can

97
00:10:54,614 --> 00:10:56,576
to recover the lost land
of the Song Dynasty.

98
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:12,169
Boss,

99
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:13,329
each of us

100
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:14,834
is working without a break every day.

101
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:16,236
We're too tired.

102
00:11:16,436 --> 00:11:17,517
I don't care.

103
00:11:17,797 --> 00:11:19,119
The Jin army may be here anytime.

104
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:20,377
If the commander

105
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:21,537
finds the walls can't stand a fight,

106
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:22,682
he'd remove my skin.

107
00:11:22,922 --> 00:11:23,922
Boss.

108
00:11:24,844 --> 00:11:25,844
Is it prepared?

109
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,166
Yes.

110
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:29,848
Keep a close watch.

111
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:31,089
Got it.

112
00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:44,944
Tai'an City.

113
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,006
Is it done?

114
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,030
Yes.

115
00:11:55,635 --> 00:11:56,635
Boss.

116
00:11:58,878 --> 00:11:59,878
What's up?

117
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,441
A cavalry is found outside the city.

118
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:08,648
Here is Tai'an City.

119
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,128
Wait for me here.

120
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:12,171
Bro,

121
00:12:12,372 --> 00:12:13,310
I don't think

122
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:14,934
we're welcome here.

123
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:16,335
I'll go with you.

124
00:12:18,258 --> 00:12:20,540
They're the volunteer
army instead of the Jin army.

125
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,637
There is nothing to worry about.

126
00:12:21,661 --> 00:12:22,661
Be careful.

127
00:12:25,465 --> 00:12:26,465
Trust me.

128
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,814
Hey. No more refugees will be taken in.

129
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:39,838
Go back.

130
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,000
We're the volunteer army
from Sifengzha Village.

131
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:43,122
We're not refugees.

132
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:45,140
You won't be taken in
no matter who you are.

133
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,164
If you keep staying here,

134
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:47,767
I'll shoot at you.

135
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:50,970
General, please report
it to your commander.

136
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:52,812
Don't you understand what I said?

137
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:54,653
Get lost.

138
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:02,782
Your arrow is too soft.

139
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:04,744
You couldn't shoot me.

140
00:13:05,064 --> 00:13:06,064
You asked for it.

141
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,806
On alert.

142
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,252
General, don't be nervous.

143
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:33,813
I'm here for a friend.

144
00:13:34,294 --> 00:13:34,854
No way!

145
00:13:35,134 --> 00:13:36,472
No matter what you say,

146
00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:38,137
I have to fight this battle.

147
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:40,195
Can't you see

148
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,620
our bros are suffering from hunger?

149
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:43,543
If we let the Jin's Supplies Battalion go,

150
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:45,561
how could I explain it to them?

151
00:13:45,585 --> 00:13:47,707
I didn't mean to stop you from fighting.

152
00:13:48,147 --> 00:13:49,147
I just asked you

153
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,709
to think about how we should do that.

154
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,513
The Supplies Battalion
has 5,000 soldiers at least.

155
00:13:53,953 --> 00:13:54,953
Make head-on attacks?

156
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:57,837
You must want to exchange our bros' lives

157
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,118
for food.

158
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:01,120
Bullshit!

159
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:02,722
Jia Rui, you damned scholar.

160
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:03,819
I'm telling you.

161
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,741
You're afraid of the Jurchen,

162
00:14:04,765 --> 00:14:06,326
but I'm not!

163
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,344
Geng Jing, let me tell you something too.

164
00:14:08,368 --> 00:14:08,985
I won't listen.

165
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:10,346
Fighting is not farming.

166
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,587
I'm just a farmer.

167
00:14:11,611 --> 00:14:12,588
Anyway, as long as I'm here,

168
00:14:12,612 --> 00:14:13,350
I won't let you go anywhere.

169
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:14,630
Nobody can stop me.

170
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:14,990
Geng.

171
00:14:15,014 --> 00:14:16,014
Go away.

172
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,900
Jia,

173
00:14:22,302 --> 00:14:22,982
are you okay?

174
00:14:23,303 --> 00:14:24,303
Commander.

175
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:25,762
What's up?

176
00:14:25,786 --> 00:14:26,786
Is the Jin army here?

177
00:14:27,226 --> 00:14:28,267
No.

178
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,308
A guy called Xin Qiji
wants to come into town.

179
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,070
He said he's Mr. Jia's former classmate.

180
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:37,756
No.

181
00:14:38,117 --> 00:14:39,117
I don't want to see him.

182
00:15:02,822 --> 00:15:04,143
Mr. Jia asked me to tell you

183
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:06,265
he doesn't want to see you.

184
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:07,827
Besides,

185
00:15:08,988 --> 00:15:10,550
the cart with grain is for you.

186
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,352
What does he mean?

187
00:15:12,752 --> 00:15:14,794
Do you think we're beggars?

188
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:16,636
What's bad about being beggars?

189
00:15:17,437 --> 00:15:18,734
In the chaos of war,

190
00:15:18,758 --> 00:15:20,936
you can count yourself lucky
if you have something to eat.

191
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,003
I'll teach you a lesson!

192
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:29,288
We'll take the food.

193
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:31,010
Go tell Jia Rui

194
00:15:31,491 --> 00:15:32,891
I'll wait for him outside the city.

195
00:15:33,092 --> 00:15:34,253
If he doesn't come to see me,

196
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:35,814
I'll keep staying here.

197
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:37,536
Langtou,

198
00:15:37,857 --> 00:15:38,857
take the grain.

199
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,339
Take the grain!

200
00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:43,903
You beggars.

201
00:15:44,384 --> 00:15:45,425
You're stubborn.

202
00:15:47,427 --> 00:15:47,843
Boss,

203
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:48,867
the meat is well cooked.

204
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,071
Step aside.

205
00:16:07,326 --> 00:16:08,408
Langtou, have a cake.

206
00:16:13,132 --> 00:16:14,132
You'an.

207
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,457
Son of a b♪tch.

208
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:19,138
It's unbearable.

209
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,700
Pick it up.

210
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:22,781
Bro!

211
00:16:27,907 --> 00:16:28,907
Bro,

212
00:16:29,308 --> 00:16:30,646
did we come here all the way

213
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,231
just to get some cakes from them?

214
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:34,833
I don't want to eat.

215
00:16:37,116 --> 00:16:38,116
Langtou.

216
00:16:38,838 --> 00:16:39,134
Neither do I.

217
00:16:39,158 --> 00:16:40,158
Me, either.

218
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,760
What do you want to do?

219
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:44,763
Come back!

220
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,217
Shuanghua,

221
00:16:59,579 --> 00:17:01,259
I'm sorry to make you go through all this.

222
00:17:02,462 --> 00:17:03,462
Don't say that.

223
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:05,745
In the chaos of war,

224
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,706
we can count ourselves lucky
if we have something to eat.

225
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:14,674
Geng Jing's forces in Tai'an
are the largest army here.

226
00:17:15,114 --> 00:17:17,557
Wanyan Liang tried many
times in vain to capture the city.

227
00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:19,117
To fight against the Jurchen,

228
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,279
we have to draw support from them.

229
00:17:23,963 --> 00:17:24,963
You'an,

230
00:17:25,885 --> 00:17:26,926
what on earth

231
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:29,408
is the Song Dynasty like?

232
00:17:32,171 --> 00:17:33,171
In the Song Dynasty,

233
00:17:35,134 --> 00:17:37,255
night markets don't finish
until 11:00 p.m. or later,

234
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:39,297
but morning markets
open as early as 3:00 a.m.

235
00:17:39,979 --> 00:17:41,260
Those popular places

236
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:42,941
are open all through the night.

237
00:17:43,301 --> 00:17:45,240
It's recorded in a book called "The
Eastern Capital: A Dream of Splendor"

238
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,322
and a painting called "Along the
River During the Qingming Festival".

239
00:17:47,346 --> 00:17:48,346
The Song Dynasty

240
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:50,829
is beautiful.

241
00:17:54,954 --> 00:17:56,996
But there is something I don't understand.

242
00:17:57,637 --> 00:17:59,358
Isn't Jia Rui your former classmate?

243
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,521
Why doesn't he want to see us?

244
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:04,219
That year, Jia Rui asked me

245
00:18:04,243 --> 00:18:05,741
to take part in the Imperial
Examinations of the Jin Dynasty.

246
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:07,102
I didn't want to be an official of the Jin,

247
00:18:07,126 --> 00:18:08,247
so I refused his invitation.

248
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:09,808
In addition to that,

249
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:11,490
I treated him to dinner and drinks.

250
00:18:12,211 --> 00:18:12,852
Three days.

251
00:18:13,212 --> 00:18:14,934
He slept for three days.

252
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,018
He must hate you to death.

253
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:21,659
It explains why he wouldn't let us go in.

254
00:18:23,462 --> 00:18:24,462
Shuanghua,

255
00:18:25,745 --> 00:18:27,947
Jia Rui is talented.

256
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:29,525
I did that

257
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:31,709
because I didn't want him
to work for the Jin Dynasty.

258
00:18:33,673 --> 00:18:34,673
Who is it?

259
00:18:37,757 --> 00:18:39,318
Bro, it's me.

260
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,961
I'm here for a cake.

261
00:18:44,804 --> 00:18:46,125
I'm wrong. I'm hungry.

262
00:18:46,646 --> 00:18:48,087
Alright. Stand up and eat!

263
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:54,532
General Hurba.

264
00:18:57,296 --> 00:18:58,296
General Hurba.

265
00:18:58,658 --> 00:18:59,658
General Hurba.

266
00:19:01,981 --> 00:19:02,461
Quick.

267
00:19:02,902 --> 00:19:04,159
Take me to His Highness.

268
00:19:04,183 --> 00:19:05,183
Got it.

269
00:19:06,265 --> 00:19:11,350
The Jin camp.

270
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,398
You went to Sifengzha with
2,000 men to recruit troops,

271
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,480
but you came back alone.

272
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:23,962
What punishment do you think you deserve?

273
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,606
I'm willing to die,

274
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:29,808
but Your Highness,

275
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:31,850
I hope you can let me kill Xin Qiji

276
00:19:32,411 --> 00:19:33,933
before that.

277
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:39,458
Do you mean Xin Zan's grandson Xin Qiji?

278
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:40,819
Exactly.

279
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,941
On that day when we
arrived at Sifengzha Village,

280
00:19:43,262 --> 00:19:44,784
we were ambushed by Xin Qiji.

281
00:19:45,424 --> 00:19:46,424
Your Highness,

282
00:19:47,026 --> 00:19:49,108
if I can't kill Xin Qiji with my own hands,

283
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:51,430
I'd die with everlasting regret.

284
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:56,636
Enough. Go get your wounds treated.

285
00:19:57,917 --> 00:19:59,078
Your Highness, I…

286
00:19:59,318 --> 00:20:00,318
Go.

287
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:10,770
Mei'er,

288
00:20:11,731 --> 00:20:13,612
what do you think of it?

289
00:20:15,975 --> 00:20:17,096
I've heard of that guy.

290
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,918
Xin Qiji is a man of both
literary and military capacity.

291
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:24,103
He's made a name for himself.

292
00:20:24,143 --> 00:20:25,905
But he wouldn't work for us

293
00:20:26,345 --> 00:20:28,307
and even led rebels to fight against us.

294
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:30,709
Father,

295
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,791
how about letting me

296
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:33,031
kill him?

297
00:20:34,353 --> 00:20:35,353
No.

298
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:39,799
In a month,

299
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,561
we'll set out to join the
Southern Expedition Army.

300
00:20:43,522 --> 00:20:44,724
Make sure you find him

301
00:20:45,364 --> 00:20:46,686
before that.

302
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:47,526
Got it.

303
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:48,927
Remember.

304
00:20:49,288 --> 00:20:50,329
Without my orders,

305
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,051
don't act rashly.

306
00:20:52,411 --> 00:20:53,411
I see.

307
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:01,901
Three days have passed.

308
00:21:02,181 --> 00:21:03,381
I don't think they're worried.

309
00:21:03,903 --> 00:21:04,560
Of course not.

310
00:21:04,584 --> 00:21:06,561
Jia has given them a cart full of grain.

311
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:07,923
It's enough for a month.

312
00:21:07,947 --> 00:21:10,107
Only three days have passed.
They don't need to worry.

313
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,568
It's lively. Even I want to go there.

314
00:21:13,592 --> 00:21:14,592
Enough.

315
00:21:14,914 --> 00:21:16,235
Don't be sarcastic.

316
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:19,614
I'll go there to have a talk with them.

317
00:21:19,638 --> 00:21:21,040
You should've done that.

318
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
Go ahead.

319
00:21:22,922 --> 00:21:23,922
I'm going.

320
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,925
What are you waiting for? Go ahead.

321
00:21:36,455 --> 00:21:36,872
This way.

322
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,896
Don't run.

323
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,297
Come here.

324
00:21:45,785 --> 00:21:46,785
He finally showed up.

325
00:21:53,793 --> 00:21:55,835
Have a rest.

326
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,085
Jia, long time no see.

327
00:22:06,966 --> 00:22:07,967
Why are you here?

328
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,488
Sifengzha is destroyed.

329
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:11,569
I'm here with them to join the army.

330
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:13,811
Your grandpa was an
official of the Jin Dynasty.

331
00:22:14,213 --> 00:22:16,335
You should join the Jin army.

332
00:22:17,777 --> 00:22:19,939
I've given you enough food.

333
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:22,942
I can give you more if
you don't think it's enough.

334
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:24,463
Many years have passed,

335
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:26,745
but you haven't got over that issue.

336
00:22:27,867 --> 00:22:28,867
Trust me.

337
00:22:29,028 --> 00:22:31,230
I came to Tai'an just to
fight against the Jurchen.

338
00:22:31,831 --> 00:22:32,928
I know you like to be an official.

339
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:35,352
I won't compete with you for
the position of vice commander.

340
00:22:35,634 --> 00:22:36,634
Xin Qiji.

341
00:22:38,918 --> 00:22:39,918
Get me my bow.

342
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:41,039
Okay.

343
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,361
Protect our vice commander.

344
00:22:48,687 --> 00:22:49,968
You want to go into town, right?

345
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:51,529
No problem.

346
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,372
A Jin army of 5,000 men

347
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:55,254
is on their way to Tai'an City.

348
00:22:55,614 --> 00:22:56,896
I'll give you 800 soldiers.

349
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,536
If you win the battle,

350
00:22:58,978 --> 00:22:59,978
I'll let you in.

351
00:23:02,741 --> 00:23:03,741
So,

352
00:23:03,903 --> 00:23:04,903
are you scared?

353
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:06,985
Get out of here if you're scared.

354
00:23:08,227 --> 00:23:09,227
500,

355
00:23:09,268 --> 00:23:10,268
I only need 500 soldiers.

356
00:23:12,631 --> 00:23:13,631
Jia Rui,

357
00:23:14,153 --> 00:23:15,554
see you in Tai'an City.

358
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,472
Bro, it's almost time. Let's do it.

359
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,433
Wait a little longer.

360
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,315
It'll be too late if we keep waiting.

361
00:23:58,237 --> 00:23:59,237
No hurry.

362
00:24:07,566 --> 00:24:08,384
Get started.

363
00:24:08,408 --> 00:24:09,768
Block the road!

364
00:24:16,055 --> 00:24:17,336
Be embattled.

365
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,227
Kill them.

366
00:24:52,251 --> 00:24:57,696
Kill them!

367
00:24:57,937 --> 00:24:58,674
Pick up your weapons.

368
00:24:58,698 --> 00:25:00,339
Reorganize a defense.

369
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:00,039
Shoot arrows!

370
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:02,377
General, our soldiers are also there.

371
00:26:02,401 --> 00:26:04,483
I ordered you to shoot
arrows. Can't you hear me?

372
00:26:04,643 --> 00:26:06,645
Yes, sir. Get ready.

373
00:26:07,446 --> 00:26:08,446
Shoot.

374
00:26:19,658 --> 00:26:20,658
Shoot.

375
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:30,845
Are you okay?

376
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:31,350
Yeah.

377
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,630
Just some scratches.

378
00:26:35,634 --> 00:26:36,634
Langtou.

379
00:26:38,037 --> 00:26:39,037
Here!

380
00:26:39,358 --> 00:26:39,855
Be a pathbreaker.

381
00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:42,841
Guys, go!

382
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:46,685
Go!

383
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:54,533
Kill them!

384
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,023
Langtou.

385
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:31,450
Their general is killed!

386
00:27:46,105 --> 00:27:47,105
You'an,

387
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:48,667
we won the battle.

388
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:50,068
Can we go into town?

389
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,669
Don't move.

390
00:27:53,152 --> 00:27:54,090
After we go into town,

391
00:27:54,114 --> 00:27:56,114
I'll get you some Jinchuang
ointment from Jia Rui.

392
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:57,875
It's nothing.

393
00:27:58,197 --> 00:27:59,198
Do you know that?

394
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,055
When I hunted with Liang

395
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,361
in the forest,

396
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,203
I was more seriously injured.

397
00:28:05,043 --> 00:28:06,205
Don't try to be a heroine.

398
00:28:06,925 --> 00:28:07,925
But to be serious,

399
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:10,167
you'd better stay away
from such things in the future.

400
00:28:12,211 --> 00:28:13,532
Are you afraid I'll be a burden?

401
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,092
No.

402
00:28:15,414 --> 00:28:17,776
I'm just worried about you.

403
00:28:19,218 --> 00:28:21,900
Bro.

404
00:28:22,981 --> 00:28:23,758
Bro.

405
00:28:23,782 --> 00:28:24,519
Langtou!

406
00:28:24,543 --> 00:28:25,543
Here!

407
00:28:25,744 --> 00:28:26,744
Bro.

408
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:28,386
Mr. Xin.

409
00:28:28,427 --> 00:28:30,549
This guy insisted on seeing you.

410
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,566
Buddy,

411
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,407
what's up?

412
00:28:32,431 --> 00:28:33,431
Mr. Xin,

413
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,034
this dagger is a spoil of
war we got from the Jin army.

414
00:28:36,235 --> 00:28:37,235
It's for you.

415
00:28:37,636 --> 00:28:38,653
For me?

416
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:39,678
Why?

417
00:28:40,038 --> 00:28:42,000
It's satisfying to fight them with you.

418
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:43,682
We admire you very much.

419
00:28:43,882 --> 00:28:44,882
Please accept it.

420
00:28:46,165 --> 00:28:46,742
Okay.

421
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,006
I'll keep it.

422
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:49,167
Okay.

423
00:28:49,408 --> 00:28:51,370
Langtou, let's go back to Tai'an.

424
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,772
Guys, we won!

425
00:29:34,893 --> 00:29:36,215
A villain enjoying success.

426
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:39,818
Mr. Jia, did you just
let them in like that?

427
00:29:40,138 --> 00:29:41,138
Or else?

428
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,943
We won't get the food
if we drive them away.

429
00:29:45,264 --> 00:29:46,264
Easy.

430
00:29:47,025 --> 00:29:49,067
We can keep the food and drive them away.

431
00:29:52,631 --> 00:29:55,193
In this case, who are villains?

432
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:02,159
Bro,

433
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,323
we risked our lives to get the grain.

434
00:30:04,563 --> 00:30:05,940
Why do you give it out to them?

435
00:30:05,964 --> 00:30:06,964
Don't you feel wronged?

436
00:30:07,446 --> 00:30:08,623
Jia Rui gave us ten dan of grain.

437
00:30:08,647 --> 00:30:09,904
We're giving 1,000 dan back to them.

438
00:30:09,928 --> 00:30:11,089
Are you unwilling to do that?

439
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,131
No.

440
00:30:13,412 --> 00:30:14,669
Let's give 1,000 dan back to them.

441
00:30:14,693 --> 00:30:16,655
It makes me happy.

442
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:19,978
Put it down!

443
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:21,218
Stop it.

444
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,700
Stop it.

445
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:24,822
Put it down.

446
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:26,784
Xin Qiji,

447
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,545
who allowed you to give the grain out here?

448
00:30:30,509 --> 00:30:32,046
We captured the grain.

449
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,512
We can deal with it as we want.

450
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:34,730
None of your business.

451
00:30:34,754 --> 00:30:35,994
Without the commander's orders,

452
00:30:36,275 --> 00:30:38,092
you're giving out grain
at will in the military

453
00:30:38,116 --> 00:30:39,477
to undermine the morale of troops.

454
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:41,079
Guys, catch him.

455
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,001
Just do it if you dare.

456
00:30:48,887 --> 00:30:50,048
You brat, what are you doing?

457
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:51,248
Bro,

458
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,387
they're giving out grain
without authorization.

459
00:30:52,411 --> 00:30:53,091
You jerk.

460
00:30:53,372 --> 00:30:55,173
Xin is Jia's former classmate.

461
00:30:55,334 --> 00:30:56,814
And he gave so much grain back to us.

462
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:59,378
Xin, you did a great job

463
00:30:59,618 --> 00:31:00,779
in the battle.

464
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,140
Mr. Geng, I'm flattered.

465
00:31:03,422 --> 00:31:05,440
Jia Rui must've had his
own plan to win the battle.

466
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:06,104
It'd be the same case

467
00:31:06,305 --> 00:31:07,305
if it were him.

468
00:31:07,426 --> 00:31:08,426
No matter what,

469
00:31:08,547 --> 00:31:10,285
your scholars are

470
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:11,069
quick-witted.

471
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,269
Mr. Geng,

472
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:13,311
we won the battle

473
00:31:13,552 --> 00:31:14,552
and we returned grain,

474
00:31:14,913 --> 00:31:16,234
but Jia Rui hasn't showed up.

475
00:31:16,475 --> 00:31:17,812
Does he want to go back on his word?

476
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:18,836
Mrs. Xin,

477
00:31:19,037 --> 00:31:20,278
don't say that.

478
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:23,161
I promise you,

479
00:31:23,402 --> 00:31:24,419
from now on,

480
00:31:24,443 --> 00:31:25,604
we're one family.

481
00:31:25,844 --> 00:31:26,844
Guys,

482
00:31:27,446 --> 00:31:28,967
enjoy yourselves tonight.

483
00:31:29,808 --> 00:31:30,808
Eat meat

484
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:31,467
and drink alcohol!

485
00:31:31,491 --> 00:31:33,027
Eat meat and drink alcohol!

486
00:31:33,051 --> 00:31:34,629
Eat meat and drink alcohol!

487
00:31:34,653 --> 00:31:36,070
Eat meat and drink alcohol!

488
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,672
Eat meat and drink alcohol!

489
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:39,097
Eat and drink as much as you want!

490
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,301
Langtou,

491
00:31:44,423 --> 00:31:45,960
you were awe-inspiring today.

492
00:31:45,984 --> 00:31:47,506
I agree.

493
00:31:48,026 --> 00:31:49,828
I'll also show you something tonight.

494
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:52,991
I'll drink all of you under the table!

495
00:31:54,152 --> 00:31:55,152
Bottoms up!

496
00:31:56,955 --> 00:31:57,955
Langtou, you silly guy.

497
00:31:58,357 --> 00:31:59,638
You're bragging again.

498
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,162
Shuanghua, I'm not.

499
00:32:04,603 --> 00:32:07,125
I'm so happy. I won't get drunk.

500
00:32:08,447 --> 00:32:11,410
Shuanghua, I want to drink a toast to you.

501
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,548
Okay. To what?

502
00:32:13,572 --> 00:32:15,333
I hope you and Xin

503
00:32:16,455 --> 00:32:18,296
can get married ASAP.

504
00:32:26,985 --> 00:32:27,985
Fill it to the top!

505
00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:33,832
Come on. Cheers.

506
00:32:34,913 --> 00:32:35,913
Cheers.

507
00:32:44,643 --> 00:32:45,643
Guys,

508
00:32:45,724 --> 00:32:46,724
let me, Zhang Anguo,

509
00:32:47,325 --> 00:32:48,927
on behalf of our buddies in Tai'an City

510
00:32:49,688 --> 00:32:51,570
and those who died in battle today,

511
00:32:52,691 --> 00:32:53,692
drink a toast to you.

512
00:33:00,058 --> 00:33:00,699
Xin,

513
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:02,220
to be honest,

514
00:33:02,501 --> 00:33:04,238
I'm really glad that

515
00:33:04,262 --> 00:33:05,504
you came here to be part of us.

516
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:07,384
Mr. Geng, thank you.

517
00:33:07,506 --> 00:33:09,283
I've heard only over
ten villagers followed you

518
00:33:09,307 --> 00:33:10,709
when you rose in rebellion,

519
00:33:11,149 --> 00:33:13,830
but you've developed into a large
army during the past three years.

520
00:33:14,032 --> 00:33:15,634
I admire you so much.

521
00:33:17,556 --> 00:33:19,494
Did you hear what he said?

522
00:33:19,518 --> 00:33:20,759
Don't yell at me again.

523
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,920
Xin Qiji,

524
00:33:23,081 --> 00:33:24,321
just get straight to the point.

525
00:33:24,723 --> 00:33:26,525
I don't believe you came to Tai'an

526
00:33:26,845 --> 00:33:28,567
just to join us.

527
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:32,770
One month ago,

528
00:33:33,251 --> 00:33:34,853
Hurba slaughtered Sifengzha.

529
00:33:35,173 --> 00:33:37,215
I've taken all the survivors here.

530
00:33:37,656 --> 00:33:38,713
Hurba…

531
00:33:38,737 --> 00:33:39,737
Hurba

532
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:42,821
is a senior general subordinate to
Wanyan Basu, a prince of the Jin.

533
00:33:43,622 --> 00:33:45,303
You want us to help you take revenge.

534
00:33:45,584 --> 00:33:46,584
In your dreams.

535
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:48,843
Let's kill him. Why not?

536
00:33:48,867 --> 00:33:50,108
I don't care who he is.

537
00:33:50,749 --> 00:33:51,749
Xin,

538
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,391
I'll help you take revenge.

539
00:33:54,272 --> 00:33:55,954
I'm bound to kill Hurba,

540
00:33:56,394 --> 00:33:58,412
but there is something else
more important than this.

541
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,397
I hope you can give me
a helping hand about that.

542
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,297
Xin, what's more important

543
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:04,483
than your revenge?

544
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:09,824
I want to gather all the volunteer army

545
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:10,848
and launch attacks

546
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:13,892
to drive all the Jurchen out of
Shandong and reclaim lost land.

547
00:34:15,534 --> 00:34:16,895
It's an idiot's daydream.

548
00:34:17,496 --> 00:34:18,496
Mr. Geng!

549
00:34:19,658 --> 00:34:20,018
They…

550
00:34:20,298 --> 00:34:20,659
Fight…

551
00:34:20,939 --> 00:34:22,460
They're fighting. Go have a look.

552
00:34:24,743 --> 00:34:25,743
Stop it!

553
00:34:28,185 --> 00:34:29,185
What's going on?

554
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,110
Bro,

555
00:34:35,233 --> 00:34:36,690
they abused us and said we're beggars,

556
00:34:36,714 --> 00:34:37,715
so I fought them.

557
00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:39,838
Bullshit!

558
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,640
What are you doing?

559
00:34:44,002 --> 00:34:45,002
Let go of me.

560
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:46,363
I have to kill him.

561
00:34:48,205 --> 00:34:49,205
You're drunk.

562
00:34:49,608 --> 00:34:50,608
Apologize.

563
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,548
He slung mud at us. It's his fault.

564
00:34:53,572 --> 00:34:54,572
Apologize.

565
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,237
Bro, it's really…

566
00:35:03,261 --> 00:35:04,261
Shut up!

567
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:16,795
Damned beggars.

568
00:35:18,877 --> 00:35:20,158
You asshole!

569
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,127
Don't say another word.

570
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:31,409
I'll pack up and leave.

571
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:32,506
From now on, no
matter if I'm alive or dead,

572
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,708
it has nothing to do with you.

573
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:35,614
Shuanghua, it's me.

574
00:35:37,896 --> 00:35:38,873
Xin also felt sorry

575
00:35:38,897 --> 00:35:40,298
to do that.

576
00:35:40,699 --> 00:35:41,916
He doesn't care about me at all.

577
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,317
All he cares about is the Song Dynasty.

578
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:44,599
There is no room for me in his heart.

579
00:35:44,623 --> 00:35:45,600
Shuanghua.

580
00:35:45,624 --> 00:35:46,825
You got him wrong.

581
00:35:47,065 --> 00:35:48,042
When he got out of

582
00:35:48,066 --> 00:35:49,523
a pile of bodies at Sifengzha,

583
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:50,989
the first one he thought of was you.

584
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:52,446
Really?

585
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,470
Of course.

586
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:54,833
He also said

587
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:55,851
he'd marry you

588
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:56,891
and go back to the Song with you

589
00:35:56,915 --> 00:35:57,956
after he kills Hurba.

590
00:36:04,202 --> 00:36:05,202
Bro.

591
00:36:06,444 --> 00:36:07,444
Shuanghua.

592
00:36:16,574 --> 00:36:17,792
The one who led the robbery

593
00:36:17,816 --> 00:36:19,513
is Xin Qiji from Jinan.

594
00:36:19,537 --> 00:36:21,099
I've heard of him.

595
00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:21,997
I've also heard.

596
00:36:22,021 --> 00:36:25,119
Xin Qiji killed the enemy's general
though they were heavily outnumbered.

597
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:26,144
He did it by flying over.

598
00:36:26,705 --> 00:36:27,705
The two of you.

599
00:36:28,066 --> 00:36:29,587
No grain for you today. Get lost.

600
00:36:30,629 --> 00:36:31,630
Why not, general?

601
00:36:34,352 --> 00:36:35,513
Why not?

602
00:36:36,274 --> 00:36:37,692
Nobody could fly.

603
00:36:37,716 --> 00:36:38,716
Get lost.

604
00:36:43,722 --> 00:36:44,722
Zhang Anguo,

605
00:36:45,443 --> 00:36:46,443
what are you doing?

606
00:36:46,645 --> 00:36:47,822
I'm giving out grain, Mr. Jia.

607
00:36:47,846 --> 00:36:49,447
Then do it seriously.

608
00:36:50,248 --> 00:36:52,370
Hold back your anger.

609
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,620
Do you want to see me?

610
00:37:03,702 --> 00:37:04,702
Yes.

611
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:07,184
I'm determined.

612
00:37:07,906 --> 00:37:09,684
I'll send an army to
fight against the Jin army.

613
00:37:09,708 --> 00:37:10,869
Are you crazy?

614
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:13,511
Are you going to help Xin Qiji take revenge

615
00:37:13,712 --> 00:37:15,233
at the risk of all our bros' lives?

616
00:37:15,473 --> 00:37:16,514
You got it wrong.

617
00:37:16,795 --> 00:37:18,917
Xin has thought about it.

618
00:37:19,397 --> 00:37:19,918
Look.

619
00:37:20,198 --> 00:37:21,638
This is Tai'an, where we're staying.

620
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,257
We're surrounded by
the enemies on all sides.

621
00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:24,281
Yanzhou.

622
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:26,284
This is Ji'nan.

623
00:37:26,564 --> 00:37:28,126
This is Zichuan.

624
00:37:28,526 --> 00:37:29,527
You're wrong.

625
00:37:30,408 --> 00:37:31,690
That's Tai'an.

626
00:37:34,733 --> 00:37:35,733
No.

627
00:37:35,934 --> 00:37:36,695
I can't make it clear.

628
00:37:36,935 --> 00:37:38,376
Xin, you explain it to him.

629
00:37:39,377 --> 00:37:40,377
Okay.

630
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,100
Look.

631
00:37:43,381 --> 00:37:45,319
With Mount Tai located at the north

632
00:37:45,343 --> 00:37:46,520
and Dawen River flowing through the south,

633
00:37:46,544 --> 00:37:48,843
Tai'an looks like a good place that
is easy to hold but hard to attack.

634
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:49,844
But lying in the center of Shandong,

635
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:50,965
it's accessible from all directions,

636
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:53,031
so it's actually in the teeth of the storm.

637
00:37:53,231 --> 00:37:54,231
You're right.

638
00:37:54,793 --> 00:37:55,473
But currently,

639
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,411
all the Jin troops in Shandong

640
00:37:57,435 --> 00:37:59,037
have been gathered by Wanyan Basu

641
00:37:59,317 --> 00:38:01,278
to go southwards and
cooperate with Wanyan Liang.

642
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:03,097
This is a good chance

643
00:38:03,121 --> 00:38:04,601
for us to rest and build up strength.

644
00:38:05,724 --> 00:38:07,004
But have you thought about that?

645
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:08,606
When they come back again

646
00:38:08,807 --> 00:38:11,505
and cooperate with troops in
Yanzhou, Jinan, Sishui and Zichuan

647
00:38:11,529 --> 00:38:13,067
to attack Tai'an,

648
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:14,091
what will happen?

649
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:16,214
We'll definitely die.

650
00:38:16,815 --> 00:38:17,375
Exactly.

651
00:38:17,776 --> 00:38:18,296
So,

652
00:38:18,576 --> 00:38:20,137
we have to take precautions beforehand.

653
00:38:20,218 --> 00:38:22,556
We should launch attacks
and capture those four cities

654
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,181
while the enemy rear is weakly defended.

655
00:38:24,743 --> 00:38:25,720
In this case, the whole Shandong province

656
00:38:25,744 --> 00:38:27,481
will be in the control
of the volunteer army.

657
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,626
Well said!

658
00:38:34,953 --> 00:38:36,034
Did you get it?

659
00:38:37,235 --> 00:38:38,716
Of course I did.

660
00:38:39,197 --> 00:38:40,414
Conquer the four cities

661
00:38:40,438 --> 00:38:41,856
and Shandong will be under our control.

662
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,321
If we fail to do that,

663
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:46,364
what happened at Sifengzha
will happen in Tai'an.

664
00:38:46,684 --> 00:38:47,684
I don't agree.

665
00:38:47,766 --> 00:38:49,103
Why not?

666
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:50,688
His words make sense.

667
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:52,449
What's the point of talking about it?

668
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:54,348
It's of no use for fighting.

669
00:38:54,372 --> 00:38:55,372
We need men to fight.

670
00:38:56,094 --> 00:38:57,175
Do we have enough soldiers?

671
00:38:58,817 --> 00:39:00,578
Amitabha.

672
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:07,025
I can do something about it.

673
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,348
Who are you?

674
00:39:11,709 --> 00:39:12,951
Who let the monk come in?

675
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:15,834
He said Xin is his friend.

676
00:39:18,036 --> 00:39:19,036
Yiduan.

677
00:39:20,879 --> 00:39:21,879
You'an.

678
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
Long time no see.

679
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:24,619
He's called Yiduan.

680
00:39:24,643 --> 00:39:26,124
He's my intimate friend.

681
00:39:28,686 --> 00:39:29,686
Generals,

682
00:39:29,928 --> 00:39:31,810
if I bring another volunteer army here,

683
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,691
will you say yes

684
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:35,413
to Xin's plan?

685
00:39:35,653 --> 00:39:36,653
Buddy,

686
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,256
how many people can you take here?

687
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:39,576
5,000.

688
00:39:39,858 --> 00:39:40,858
Amazing.

689
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:42,037
Jia,

690
00:39:42,061 --> 00:39:43,541
stop hesitating.

691
00:39:43,741 --> 00:39:44,639
If we do it,

692
00:39:44,663 --> 00:39:46,464
all of us will benefit from it.

693
00:39:47,225 --> 00:39:48,002
Are you sure you'll do it?

694
00:39:48,026 --> 00:39:48,844
Yes!

695
00:39:48,868 --> 00:39:50,428
Okay. Let's do it.

696
00:39:51,149 --> 00:39:52,150
But I have a condition.

697
00:39:53,711 --> 00:39:54,913
Before the army arrives,

698
00:39:55,473 --> 00:39:57,755
you have to stay here in Tai'an.

699
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:00,919
Please send a messenger

700
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:02,120
to do it on behalf of me.

701
00:40:06,925 --> 00:40:08,206
Did you read the letter?

702
00:40:08,967 --> 00:40:09,967
Yeah.

703
00:40:10,288 --> 00:40:11,609
I didn't find anything wrong.

704
00:40:13,051 --> 00:40:14,051
That'd be great.

705
00:40:15,653 --> 00:40:17,255
That monk showed up suddenly.

706
00:40:17,535 --> 00:40:18,535
It's a little weird.

707
00:40:18,857 --> 00:40:20,418
Ask Zhang Anguo to keep watch on him.

708
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,462
Geng,

709
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:26,064
don't you have confidence

710
00:40:27,105 --> 00:40:28,306
about the issue?

711
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:32,350
I just have confidence in Xin.

712
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:34,392
I didn't read much.

713
00:40:34,552 --> 00:40:37,355
I'm uneducated, but I'm not stupid.

714
00:40:39,117 --> 00:40:40,117
Let's go and drink.

715
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:41,358
Cheers.

716
00:40:46,084 --> 00:40:47,101
Yiduan,

717
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:48,686
aren't you a monk?

718
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:50,784
Why do you drink alcohol

719
00:40:50,808 --> 00:40:51,809
and eat meat?

720
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:56,453
I'm ashamed to say that.

721
00:40:56,774 --> 00:40:59,273
As a monk, I was supposed to
chant sutras and practice meditation.

722
00:40:59,297 --> 00:41:00,337
But in the troubled times,

723
00:41:00,538 --> 00:41:01,858
seeing people be in great misery,

724
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,902
I just can't sit by and watch.

725
00:41:04,702 --> 00:41:05,702
So I left the temple

726
00:41:05,783 --> 00:41:07,441
and joined the volunteer army in the north.

727
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,625
I was captured by the Jin
army after we lost a battle.

728
00:41:09,707 --> 00:41:10,707
Then I saw you.

729
00:41:11,149 --> 00:41:12,047
I see.

730
00:41:12,071 --> 00:41:14,512
Yiduan, you escaped from the Jin army.

731
00:41:16,314 --> 00:41:17,314
Langtou,

732
00:41:18,917 --> 00:41:20,014
don't you want to learn swordsmanship?

733
00:41:20,038 --> 00:41:22,000
Yiduan is a master of it.

734
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,377
Take this opportunity

735
00:41:23,401 --> 00:41:24,762
to ask him for some good advice.

736
00:41:25,203 --> 00:41:26,404
Okay. I'll try.

737
00:41:31,609 --> 00:41:32,506
Yiduan,

738
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:33,467
Langtou is simple-minded.

739
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,732
Don't take his words seriously.

740
00:41:35,253 --> 00:41:36,253
It's okay.

741
00:41:36,454 --> 00:41:38,896
It's like the Jin army made
us meet each other again.

742
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:44,438
Since we separated in Ji'nan,

743
00:41:44,462 --> 00:41:45,462
three years have passed.

744
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:46,583
Time flies.

745
00:41:48,226 --> 00:41:49,307
When I was young,

746
00:41:49,547 --> 00:41:50,724
I was good at playing backgammon,

747
00:41:50,748 --> 00:41:53,031
but it's just a minor thing in my mind.

748
00:41:59,637 --> 00:42:00,637
Bro,

749
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:03,817
I'm not good at the
swordsmanship you taught me.

750
00:42:03,841 --> 00:42:04,841
Yiduan.

751
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:10,408
Bro, how about you doing it?

752
00:42:10,648 --> 00:42:11,970
Shuanghua likes to see you.

753
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:13,810
What did you say?

754
00:42:15,213 --> 00:42:16,933
You like to see him practice swordsmanship.

755
00:42:19,417 --> 00:42:20,417
You'an,

756
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:22,338
I also haven't seen
you do it for a long time.

757
00:42:23,982 --> 00:42:26,104
Okay. I'll present a show.

758
00:42:36,434 --> 00:42:38,036
When I was young,

759
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:39,757
I was good at playing backgammon,

760
00:42:45,643 --> 00:42:48,166
but it's just a minor thing in my mind.

761
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:55,613
I observed from the
sidelines the first time I saw it.

762
00:42:56,614 --> 00:42:58,656
I knew little about it at that time.

763
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:06,680
In a very short time,

764
00:43:06,704 --> 00:43:08,162
the gull turned over the stone mirror

765
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:10,468
and the magpie arrived at the star bridge.

766
00:43:13,551 --> 00:43:14,992
The clothes-pounding stone

767
00:43:15,433 --> 00:43:18,196
still missed those slim fingers.

768
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,421
Yiduan succeeded.

769
00:43:44,142 --> 00:43:45,743
He'll help us when we arrive at Tai'an.

770
00:43:46,384 --> 00:43:47,242
No siege weapons.

771
00:43:47,266 --> 00:43:48,826
No army provisions or carriages.

772
00:43:49,947 --> 00:43:52,005
Just let the soldiers take
enough food for three days.

773
00:43:52,029 --> 00:43:52,670
Dispatch my order.

774
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,569
800 people of Flying Eagle Army
will go with me to attack Tai'an at night.

775
00:43:55,593 --> 00:43:56,074
Your Highness,

776
00:43:56,554 --> 00:43:57,715
is it too risky?

777
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,840
A saying in the Song Dynasty goes that

778
00:44:04,482 --> 00:44:06,043
nothing ventured, nothing gained.

779
00:44:07,365 --> 00:44:08,365
Go dispatch my order.

780
00:44:08,966 --> 00:44:09,966
Got it.

781
00:44:11,689 --> 00:44:12,689
Your Highness,

782
00:44:13,771 --> 00:44:15,451
have you found out Xin Qiji's whereabouts?

783
00:44:51,609 --> 00:44:52,650
Why are you here?

784
00:44:53,131 --> 00:44:55,373
Bro, yesterday…

785
00:44:56,494 --> 00:44:57,494
I don't know.

786
00:44:59,177 --> 00:45:00,177
Go!

787
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:02,098
Go.

788
00:45:06,864 --> 00:45:07,864
Why are you in a hurry?

789
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:09,867
You drank too much last night,

790
00:45:10,027 --> 00:45:11,027
so you slept here.

791
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:13,830
Oh.

792
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,513
Let's go have a look at Yiduan.

793
00:45:15,753 --> 00:45:16,730
He also drank a lot last night.

794
00:45:16,754 --> 00:45:17,754
Yeah.

795
00:45:23,801 --> 00:45:25,363
What are you doing?

796
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:30,888
Mr. Geng,

797
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:32,329
what do you mean?

798
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:33,891
Stop playing innocent.

799
00:45:34,452 --> 00:45:35,829
Yiduan stole the commander's seal.

800
00:45:35,853 --> 00:45:36,853
And he injured me.

801
00:45:36,974 --> 00:45:37,974
What would you say?

802
00:45:38,216 --> 00:45:38,816
Zhang,

803
00:45:39,056 --> 00:45:40,056
stop slandering us.

804
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:41,898
We drank with him till almost daybreak.

805
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,637
How could he steal the seal?

806
00:45:43,661 --> 00:45:45,239
Bro, he's trying to find faults!

807
00:45:45,263 --> 00:45:47,463
It's me that asked Zhang
Anguo to keep watch on Yiduan.

808
00:45:47,505 --> 00:45:48,642
He stole the commander's seal

809
00:45:48,666 --> 00:45:50,484
probably because he wants
to issue fake military orders

810
00:45:50,508 --> 00:45:51,229
and make a mess

811
00:45:51,469 --> 00:45:52,367
to help the Jin army

812
00:45:52,391 --> 00:45:54,672
conquer Tai'an.

813
00:45:56,514 --> 00:45:57,514
Xin,

814
00:45:57,875 --> 00:45:59,397
I believe you're fooled by Yiduan.

815
00:45:59,797 --> 00:46:00,797
Shuanghua,

816
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,159
wait for me here with Langtou.

817
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,297
I'll get the seal back.

818
00:46:03,321 --> 00:46:04,321
Bro.

819
00:46:06,204 --> 00:46:07,444
If I fail to come back tonight,

820
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:08,982
don't make things difficult for my bros.

821
00:46:09,006 --> 00:46:10,006
Okay.

822
00:46:10,488 --> 00:46:11,488
I promise.

823
00:46:11,609 --> 00:46:13,291
As long as you get the seal back,

824
00:46:13,491 --> 00:46:14,491
I'll help you

825
00:46:14,692 --> 00:46:16,013
with the northern expedition.

826
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,855
Xin Qiji.

827
00:46:19,617 --> 00:46:20,617
Yiduan

828
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:22,340
went toward the withered forest.

829
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:28,346
Your Highness,

830
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:30,244
Tai'an is only 100 km away.

831
00:46:30,268 --> 00:46:31,268
Full speed ahead!

832
00:46:33,871 --> 00:46:34,871
Full speed ahead!

833
00:47:19,277 --> 00:47:20,277
Go back with me.

834
00:47:25,403 --> 00:47:26,403
Don't be stupid.

835
00:47:26,524 --> 00:47:27,605
You couldn't defend Tai'an.

836
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,092
We once promised to
recover the lost Central Plain.

837
00:47:35,493 --> 00:47:37,375
Yiduan, did you forget it?

838
00:47:37,615 --> 00:47:39,415
Whoever understands
the times is a great man.

839
00:47:40,017 --> 00:47:41,515
There is a tendency for
the Song Dynasty to decline.

840
00:47:41,539 --> 00:47:43,699
Even if the world is under
the control of the Jurchen,

841
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:45,942
the masses can still live a peaceful life.

842
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:47,664
Let me ask you again.

843
00:47:48,746 --> 00:47:50,027
Will you go back with me or not?

844
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:55,072
The sea of bitterness has
bounds, but there is no turning back.

845
00:47:56,834 --> 00:47:58,635
Now that you insist on
betraying our country,

846
00:47:58,796 --> 00:47:59,796
from now on,

847
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:02,079
you're no longer my friend.

848
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,762
You're my enemy.

849
00:48:05,242 --> 00:48:06,242
Come on.

850
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:31,468
The Jin army will be here tonight.

851
00:48:31,629 --> 00:48:32,629
You'an,

852
00:48:34,952 --> 00:48:36,233
go fulfill your ideals.

853
00:49:03,501 --> 00:49:04,542
It seems he did it.

854
00:49:06,384 --> 00:49:07,704
Half of you stay here for backup.

855
00:49:08,025 --> 00:49:09,025
Let's go.

856
00:49:25,403 --> 00:49:26,403
Yiduan.

857
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:29,407
You need to draw your sword from a sheath

858
00:49:29,647 --> 00:49:31,449
and wipe out the disgrace.

859
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:34,050
Hurba,

860
00:49:35,052 --> 00:49:36,494
do you still remember me?

861
00:49:43,821 --> 00:49:44,821
Who is it?

862
00:49:46,784 --> 00:49:49,467
Why is someone peeping at me peeing?

863
00:49:54,231 --> 00:49:56,153
I'm here to kill you.

864
00:50:13,851 --> 00:50:14,532
Give the signal.

865
00:50:14,852 --> 00:50:18,616
Don't bother. I've killed him.

866
00:50:21,098 --> 00:50:22,098
Get ready.

867
00:50:26,704 --> 00:50:28,745
I'm Wanyan Chengmei, a
princess of the Jin Dynasty.

868
00:50:29,386 --> 00:50:30,908
If I die here today,

869
00:50:31,348 --> 00:50:34,391
the Jin cavalry will tread down Tai'an

870
00:50:34,752 --> 00:50:35,752
at all costs.

871
00:50:36,674 --> 00:50:38,916
She's a princess.

872
00:50:39,316 --> 00:50:40,054
Bros,

873
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,519
don't injure her.

874
00:50:41,799 --> 00:50:43,881
I've been single for over ten years.

875
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:45,521
I'm thinking about getting married.

876
00:50:48,886 --> 00:50:49,886
Geng Jing,

877
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,946
you sent an army into battle just
because you don't want to fight.

878
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:54,868
Today, I promise

879
00:50:54,892 --> 00:50:55,989
in the name of a princess
of the Jin Dynasty,

880
00:50:56,013 --> 00:50:57,631
you'll be a senior official with good pay

881
00:50:57,655 --> 00:51:00,137
as long as you give in,

882
00:51:00,858 --> 00:51:02,059
and all your bros

883
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:04,221
will live a good life too.

884
00:51:06,504 --> 00:51:08,562
Xin, she can't get my point.

885
00:51:08,586 --> 00:51:09,586
You talk to her.

886
00:51:09,627 --> 00:51:10,627
Wanyan Chengmei,

887
00:51:10,948 --> 00:51:12,205
don't waste your words.

888
00:51:12,229 --> 00:51:14,592
I can spare you if you put down weapons.

889
00:51:15,753 --> 00:51:18,492
All of you, go back to the Jin camp

890
00:51:18,516 --> 00:51:19,773
and tell Wanyan Basu…

891
00:51:19,797 --> 00:51:21,615
…Wanyan Basu won't leave it at that.

892
00:51:21,639 --> 00:51:23,120
…we'll take back every inch of land

893
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,457
the Jurchen took away.

894
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:26,722
The plan of conquering the
four cities will be affected.

895
00:51:28,005 --> 00:51:29,647
Do you agree to that?

896
00:51:31,368 --> 00:51:32,626
You're cunning.

897
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:33,650
Xin Qiji,

898
00:51:33,851 --> 00:51:35,012
we'll see each other again.

899
00:51:40,898 --> 00:51:41,898
Let's go.

900
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,100
Hold on.

901
00:51:45,623 --> 00:51:47,705
He has to stay.

902
00:51:49,186 --> 00:51:50,186
Your Highness,

903
00:51:50,427 --> 00:51:51,909
I've been looking forward to it.

904
00:51:57,394 --> 00:51:58,394
Hurba,

905
00:51:59,276 --> 00:52:00,638
I'll make you a human sacrifice

906
00:52:01,078 --> 00:52:02,800
to my bros who died at Sifengzha.

907
00:52:21,378 --> 00:52:24,541
I lost. Kill me.

908
00:52:25,222 --> 00:52:27,825
It's not me that will kill you.

909
00:52:48,646 --> 00:52:51,368
Liang, I avenged your death.

910
00:52:51,889 --> 00:52:54,411
Rest in peace!

911
00:52:57,615 --> 00:53:00,858
All bros who died at Sifengzha,

912
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:02,700
Xin has avenged your death.

913
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:04,742
We killed Hurba.

914
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:06,582
And tomorrow,

915
00:53:06,984 --> 00:53:09,226
Xin will serve as general
secretary of Tai'an City.

916
00:53:10,307 --> 00:53:13,631
I'll follow him

917
00:53:14,471 --> 00:53:17,154
and beat down the Jin army!

918
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:22,720
Shuanghua.

919
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:23,297
Let go of me.

920
00:53:23,321 --> 00:53:24,481
Shuanghua, listen to me.

921
00:53:24,802 --> 00:53:26,299
This is the only chance
to defeat the Jin army.

922
00:53:26,323 --> 00:53:27,300
Only after driving them off…

923
00:53:27,324 --> 00:53:28,325
Can you stop fighting?

924
00:53:51,949 --> 00:53:53,390
When this issue is done,

925
00:53:54,672 --> 00:53:55,672
I'll do nothing

926
00:53:55,993 --> 00:53:57,314
but to stay by your side

927
00:53:57,675 --> 00:53:58,675
for the rest of my life.

928
00:53:59,717 --> 00:54:00,717
Okay?

929
00:54:27,544 --> 00:54:28,826
From today on,

930
00:54:29,106 --> 00:54:32,085
Xin will be general secretary
of the volunteer army.

931
00:54:32,109 --> 00:54:33,230
Great!

932
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:35,671
Bro,

933
00:54:36,353 --> 00:54:37,674
it's us that fought battles.

934
00:54:39,036 --> 00:54:40,653
Why do you let him serve
as general secretary?

935
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:42,215
Zhang Anguo, stop talking rubbish!

936
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:44,177
Of course Xin will hold the post.

937
00:54:44,201 --> 00:54:45,362
Can we count on you?

938
00:54:45,883 --> 00:54:47,364
Cut the crap. Fill the bowls.

939
00:54:56,253 --> 00:54:58,351
I know many of you are not happy

940
00:54:58,375 --> 00:54:59,815
about me becoming general secretary.

941
00:54:59,897 --> 00:55:00,977
In terms of qualifications,

942
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:02,098
I'm inferior to you.

943
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:03,477
In terms of meritorious military service,

944
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:05,542
you've won nearly 100
battles large and small.

945
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,064
I'm still inferior.

946
00:55:07,344 --> 00:55:09,562
So, I don't feel qualified to hold the post

947
00:55:09,586 --> 00:55:10,707
in any respect.

948
00:55:11,588 --> 00:55:12,910
But I want to ask you a question.

949
00:55:13,670 --> 00:55:14,848
Why did you choose to rise up?

950
00:55:14,872 --> 00:55:16,609
To eat my fill and dress warm.

951
00:55:16,633 --> 00:55:18,115
To marry a good woman.

952
00:55:20,037 --> 00:55:22,495
To eat your fill, to dress warm
and to marry a good woman.

953
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:23,961
It's the same case for me.

954
00:55:24,962 --> 00:55:27,845
But the Jurchen don't agree.

955
00:55:28,766 --> 00:55:31,648
To defeat them, we have to do two things.

956
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:32,529
The first is

957
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:33,530
to unite as one.

958
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:34,829
From now on,

959
00:55:34,853 --> 00:55:36,870
all the volunteer troops from Sifengzha
and Tai'an are comrades-in-arms.

960
00:55:36,894 --> 00:55:39,216
You should share life
and death with each other.

961
00:55:39,616 --> 00:55:40,616
The second is

962
00:55:40,818 --> 00:55:41,979
still to unite as one.

963
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:43,636
No matter where we go,

964
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:45,542
we shall not infringe
on people's interests.

965
00:55:45,783 --> 00:55:46,880
Only with the masses' support

966
00:55:46,904 --> 00:55:48,121
can we drive all the Jurchen

967
00:55:48,145 --> 00:55:50,027
out of the territory of the Song Dynasty.

968
00:55:54,872 --> 00:55:57,851
Why did you say there's nothing to wear?
I'll take my own cloak for you to share.

969
00:55:57,875 --> 00:56:00,197
Expel the invaders
even at the cost of my life!

970
00:56:00,277 --> 00:56:02,976
Expel the invaders
even at the cost of my life!

971
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:03,416
Cheers!

972
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,440
Cheers!

973
00:57:58,355 --> 00:57:59,355
Don't run.

974
00:58:10,127 --> 00:58:11,728
Hey. Stop chasing.

975
00:58:13,931 --> 00:58:14,971
Go inside and have a look.

976
00:58:39,876 --> 00:58:41,238
Give me a little bit.

977
00:58:41,758 --> 00:58:42,815
Don't push.

978
00:58:42,839 --> 00:58:44,280
Everyone can get a portion. Come on.

979
00:58:44,401 --> 00:58:45,482
Everyone can get a portion.

980
00:58:46,803 --> 00:58:48,645
I'm a soldier. I joined the army!

981
00:58:50,887 --> 00:58:52,209
I really didn't expect

982
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:54,307
the more battles we fought,

983
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:56,453
the larger army we have.

984
00:58:57,094 --> 00:58:59,054
It's an irresistible trend.
It's bound to happen.

985
00:58:59,136 --> 00:59:00,497
When we conquer Zichuan at one go,

986
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:01,675
the volunteer army will have a foothold

987
00:59:01,699 --> 00:59:02,859
in the Central Plain.

988
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,541
I finally see.

989
00:59:04,781 --> 00:59:06,143
As long as you're here,

990
00:59:06,423 --> 00:59:08,825
the volunteer army will
be stronger and stronger.

991
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,388
You'an, I've got you a book.

992
00:59:12,829 --> 00:59:13,886
Geng, look.

993
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:14,910
Go. Let's have a look.

994
00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:23,119
Back off.

995
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:24,978
Stop it!

996
00:59:25,002 --> 00:59:26,002
Langtou.

997
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:27,083
Stop it.

998
00:59:27,244 --> 00:59:28,365
Langtou, what are you doing?

999
00:59:29,046 --> 00:59:30,046
Langtou.

1000
00:59:31,008 --> 00:59:32,008
What's going on?

1001
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:34,891
Are you addicted to fighting?

1002
00:59:36,373 --> 00:59:37,373
Mr. Geng,

1003
00:59:38,015 --> 00:59:38,992
he tied Xiaoheizi up,

1004
00:59:39,016 --> 00:59:40,257
so I fought him.

1005
00:59:41,138 --> 00:59:41,698
Langtou,

1006
00:59:42,019 --> 00:59:43,019
who did you tie up?

1007
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:44,901
Take him here.

1008
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:46,382
Let go of me!

1009
00:59:47,944 --> 00:59:48,944
Go.

1010
00:59:49,226 --> 00:59:49,666
Kneel down.

1011
00:59:49,906 --> 00:59:50,906
Bro,

1012
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:51,548
this guy

1013
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:53,046
robbed the common people of their food.

1014
00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:54,391
He even used his knife.

1015
00:59:55,152 --> 00:59:56,152
Where are they?

1016
00:59:56,313 --> 00:59:57,794
They're scared away.

1017
00:59:58,635 --> 01:00:00,157
The sheep is killed by him.

1018
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,597
Xiaoheizi,

1019
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:03,480
did you do it?

1020
01:00:05,402 --> 01:00:06,402
I…

1021
01:00:06,763 --> 01:00:09,524
It's me that injured them and it's
me that robbed them of their food.

1022
01:00:10,327 --> 01:00:11,888
But they're the Jurchen.

1023
01:00:12,089 --> 01:00:13,490
They're also part of the masses!

1024
01:00:14,651 --> 01:00:15,651
Langtou,

1025
01:00:15,932 --> 01:00:17,070
punish him according to military law.

1026
01:00:17,094 --> 01:00:17,710
Bro.

1027
01:00:17,734 --> 01:00:18,895
It's not that serious, right?

1028
01:00:19,656 --> 01:00:20,137
Kill him.

1029
01:00:20,377 --> 01:00:21,377
Just try it.

1030
01:00:21,418 --> 01:00:22,018
What are you doing?

1031
01:00:22,419 --> 01:00:23,419
Mr. Geng,

1032
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:25,462
Xin Qiji even let a princess of the Jin go.

1033
01:00:25,662 --> 01:00:27,303
Why can't he forgive Xiaoheizi this time?

1034
01:00:27,904 --> 01:00:28,904
He must have

1035
01:00:29,186 --> 01:00:30,203
ulterior motives.

1036
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:31,164
Cut the crap.

1037
01:00:31,188 --> 01:00:32,188
Get lost.

1038
01:00:38,995 --> 01:00:39,995
Xin,

1039
01:00:40,597 --> 01:00:42,439
Xiaoheizi did it wrong this time.

1040
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,641
I'll give 20 sheep back to them.

1041
01:00:44,921 --> 01:00:45,921
No. 30.

1042
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:47,724
And I'll whip Xiaoheizi 40 times.

1043
01:00:48,405 --> 01:00:49,686
What do you think?

1044
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:51,167
Mr. Geng,

1045
01:00:51,488 --> 01:00:53,249
we shall not infringe
on people's interests.

1046
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:54,330
That's the rule.

1047
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:55,851
Military law is ruthless.

1048
01:00:56,012 --> 01:00:57,294
He has to pay for what he did.

1049
01:00:58,335 --> 01:00:59,335
Okay.

1050
01:00:59,416 --> 01:01:00,416
How about like this?

1051
01:01:01,017 --> 01:01:02,259
From today on,

1052
01:01:02,459 --> 01:01:04,597
anyone who violates it will be beheaded.

1053
01:01:04,621 --> 01:01:05,621
Okay?

1054
01:01:09,386 --> 01:01:10,386
That year

1055
01:01:10,747 --> 01:01:12,589
when I traveled around
China with my grandpa,

1056
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:15,190
we saw the officials of the Jin Dynasty

1057
01:01:15,232 --> 01:01:16,712
treat the common people like animals.

1058
01:01:17,434 --> 01:01:18,651
They robbed people of their money,

1059
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:19,675
of their grain

1060
01:01:19,796 --> 01:01:20,796
and of their women.

1061
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:23,118
If they were refused,
they'd beat them hard.

1062
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,480
If they were still refused,

1063
01:01:24,561 --> 01:01:25,561
they'd kill them.

1064
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:27,282
They didn't kill one or two people,

1065
01:01:28,004 --> 01:01:29,165
but killed the whole village.

1066
01:01:31,128 --> 01:01:32,128
That's how.

1067
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:34,171
Sifengzha was destroyed.

1068
01:01:40,297 --> 01:01:41,297
So,

1069
01:01:41,818 --> 01:01:43,460
since the day I rose up,

1070
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:45,061
I've made up my mind.

1071
01:01:45,662 --> 01:01:46,639
If the Song Dynasty

1072
01:01:46,663 --> 01:01:48,505
recovers the lost land someday,

1073
01:01:48,945 --> 01:01:50,483
I won't let any of the common people

1074
01:01:50,507 --> 01:01:51,684
endure such suffering

1075
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:52,725
and live such a miserable life

1076
01:01:52,749 --> 01:01:53,910
in the Song territory.

1077
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:56,312
Kill him!

1078
01:01:56,953 --> 01:01:57,953
How dare you?

1079
01:02:01,998 --> 01:02:03,360
Jia Rui, what are you doing?

1080
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:04,640
Bro.

1081
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:05,298
Mr. Xin.

1082
01:02:05,322 --> 01:02:06,220
I did it wrong.

1083
01:02:06,244 --> 01:02:07,404
Actually, I…

1084
01:02:18,054 --> 01:02:18,832
Zhang Anguo!

1085
01:02:18,856 --> 01:02:20,096
I'll kill you!

1086
01:02:20,577 --> 01:02:21,618
Catch him!

1087
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:24,300
Come back!

1088
01:02:25,061 --> 01:02:26,463
Isn't it enough that he's killed?

1089
01:03:15,392 --> 01:03:16,392
Hey. Step aside.

1090
01:03:30,287 --> 01:03:31,287
Step aside.

1091
01:03:35,732 --> 01:03:36,732
Jia,

1092
01:03:36,853 --> 01:03:37,853
do you want to see me?

1093
01:03:41,698 --> 01:03:42,698
Mei'er,

1094
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:45,061
it's your turn.

1095
01:03:51,147 --> 01:03:52,147
Father,

1096
01:03:52,589 --> 01:03:53,829
they've conquered three cities.

1097
01:03:54,711 --> 01:03:55,992
Do we just sit by and watch?

1098
01:03:57,113 --> 01:04:00,437
So what? You lost to Xin Qiji.

1099
01:04:00,917 --> 01:04:02,038
Are you unconvinced?

1100
01:04:03,159 --> 01:04:04,240
I was so careless

1101
01:04:04,481 --> 01:04:05,562
as to be trapped.

1102
01:04:06,323 --> 01:04:08,405
You acted rashly.

1103
01:04:09,406 --> 01:04:10,406
Come on.

1104
01:04:12,969 --> 01:04:13,969
Mr. Jia.

1105
01:04:14,130 --> 01:04:14,411
No.

1106
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:16,373
Don't call me Mr. Jia.

1107
01:04:16,933 --> 01:04:18,871
We learned from the same
teacher for several years.

1108
01:04:18,895 --> 01:04:19,936
Just call me Jia Rui.

1109
01:04:21,017 --> 01:04:22,017
Cheers.

1110
01:04:22,739 --> 01:04:23,739
Cheers.

1111
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:30,265
You'an,

1112
01:04:30,987 --> 01:04:33,109
I got you wrong.

1113
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:34,990
To this day,

1114
01:04:35,111 --> 01:04:36,393
I finally understand

1115
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:38,234
what lofty ambitions mean.

1116
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:41,037
Let me drink one more toast to you.

1117
01:04:50,727 --> 01:04:51,727
Jia,

1118
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:55,651
I also have something to say to you.

1119
01:04:56,973 --> 01:04:58,294
Including Tai'an,

1120
01:04:58,575 --> 01:05:00,015
we've got four cities under control.

1121
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:01,296
If we conquer Zichuan,

1122
01:05:01,818 --> 01:05:03,940
the whole Shandong will be in our hand.

1123
01:05:04,421 --> 01:05:06,102
It's hard to conquer Zichuan,

1124
01:05:06,863 --> 01:05:08,465
but through the journey, I also found.

1125
01:05:08,825 --> 01:05:10,963
Wanyan Basu has transferred

1126
01:05:10,987 --> 01:05:12,108
all the main forces.

1127
01:05:12,629 --> 01:05:13,710
We conquered three cities,

1128
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:15,472
but he didn't send any reinforcements.

1129
01:05:15,992 --> 01:05:18,755
It seems he's determined
to go to the south.

1130
01:05:19,396 --> 01:05:19,996
So,

1131
01:05:20,357 --> 01:05:22,695
there is something we
have to do beforehand.

1132
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:23,719
What is it?

1133
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:25,498
To cooperate with the northern
expedition army of the Song

1134
01:05:25,522 --> 01:05:27,083
and suppress Wanyan Basu.

1135
01:05:28,124 --> 01:05:29,366
Easier said than done.

1136
01:05:30,046 --> 01:05:31,704
Maybe the emperor of Song

1137
01:05:31,728 --> 01:05:33,490
won't agree to his plan.

1138
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:35,250
Even if he agrees,

1139
01:05:35,892 --> 01:05:37,253
including us,

1140
01:05:37,534 --> 01:05:40,497
three armies are going
south to meet each other.

1141
01:05:40,777 --> 01:05:42,058
Once we do it,

1142
01:05:43,099 --> 01:05:44,259
we'll have one million troops

1143
01:05:44,581 --> 01:05:47,223
to attack the Song Dynasty.

1144
01:05:47,864 --> 01:05:49,666
By then, Xin's troops

1145
01:05:51,227 --> 01:05:52,829
will be a drop in the bucket.

1146
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:55,791
Look.

1147
01:05:55,872 --> 01:05:56,993
We've conquered Tai'an,

1148
01:05:57,273 --> 01:05:57,834
Sishui,

1149
01:05:58,194 --> 01:05:58,795
Yanzhou

1150
01:05:59,115 --> 01:06:00,115
and Jinan.

1151
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:01,213
When we take control of Zichuan,

1152
01:06:01,237 --> 01:06:03,335
it means we can cast a big net

1153
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:04,920
on Wanyan Basu's way back to the north.

1154
01:06:05,201 --> 01:06:06,419
As long as the Song army

1155
01:06:06,443 --> 01:06:07,644
pushes them to this place,

1156
01:06:07,884 --> 01:06:09,982
with the five cities launching
attacks at the same time,

1157
01:06:10,006 --> 01:06:11,384
and support from the Song army,

1158
01:06:11,408 --> 01:06:12,745
we'll wipe out Wanyan Basu and his army

1159
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:14,330
completely in the net.

1160
01:06:14,691 --> 01:06:15,691
In this case,

1161
01:06:15,812 --> 01:06:17,213
Wanyan Liang's southern expedition

1162
01:06:17,454 --> 01:06:18,935
will collapse without being attacked.

1163
01:06:19,936 --> 01:06:20,936
I see.

1164
01:06:22,459 --> 01:06:24,501
Xin Qijin told us his plan on purpose

1165
01:06:25,502 --> 01:06:27,279
because he wanted to
delay us going to the south.

1166
01:06:27,303 --> 01:06:29,946
Xin Qiji is really talented,

1167
01:06:31,508 --> 01:06:33,590
with great vision and thought.

1168
01:06:34,511 --> 01:06:36,352
If the Song army does as he says,

1169
01:06:37,313 --> 01:06:39,114
things will be difficult
for us to deal with.

1170
01:06:39,756 --> 01:06:42,559
Father, shall we go to
the south beforehand?

1171
01:06:42,839 --> 01:06:43,839
No.

1172
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:46,963
Xin Qiji is a formidable opponent,

1173
01:06:47,444 --> 01:06:50,487
but those rebels don't unite as one.

1174
01:06:52,128 --> 01:06:54,568
The highest form of generalship
is to balk the enemy's plans.

1175
01:06:56,493 --> 01:07:01,498
Mei'er, you have to learn to
kill someone by another's hand.

1176
01:07:02,338 --> 01:07:03,580
It's not easy

1177
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:06,142
to see the emperor.

1178
01:07:06,863 --> 01:07:08,144
Don't worry.

1179
01:07:08,424 --> 01:07:09,786
I have an old friend in Lin'an.

1180
01:07:10,066 --> 01:07:11,427
He can do me a favor.

1181
01:07:11,828 --> 01:07:12,828
Jia,

1182
01:07:13,389 --> 01:07:14,951
I'll leave the Zichuan case to you.

1183
01:07:15,752 --> 01:07:17,273
Okay. Trust me.

1184
01:07:17,794 --> 01:07:19,035
I won't let you down.

1185
01:07:19,676 --> 01:07:20,036
Cheers.

1186
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:21,436
Cheers.

1187
01:07:21,878 --> 01:07:22,878
I see.

1188
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:24,641
I'll send word that

1189
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:27,259
for anyone who surrenders,
we'll let bygones be bygones.

1190
01:07:27,283 --> 01:07:29,886
And he'll be given a post
according to his military merits.

1191
01:07:31,848 --> 01:07:35,371
Mei'er, you're extremely
intelligent. Go get it done.

1192
01:07:35,492 --> 01:07:36,492
Got it.

1193
01:07:41,898 --> 01:07:46,062
"With fine bows and arrows, the
Huns want to invade the Han Dynasty."

1194
01:07:47,023 --> 01:07:50,707
"An army of 300,000 soldiers led
by a valiant general like Huo Qubing

1195
01:07:51,347 --> 01:07:55,912
is sent to fight against the enemy."

1196
01:08:20,857 --> 01:08:21,938
Mr. Geng.

1197
01:08:25,341 --> 01:08:27,023
Did you come to me late at night

1198
01:08:28,024 --> 01:08:29,265
to discuss something with me?

1199
01:08:29,826 --> 01:08:32,525
Three years ago, I rose
up with some of my bros

1200
01:08:32,549 --> 01:08:34,030
just to eat our fill.

1201
01:08:35,832 --> 01:08:37,754
We've become more powerful,

1202
01:08:38,234 --> 01:08:40,076
but I don't forget my original intention.

1203
01:08:41,037 --> 01:08:43,519
Mr. Geng, what do you mean?

1204
01:08:45,682 --> 01:08:46,682
Buddy,

1205
01:08:49,405 --> 01:08:50,607
I don't want to fight anymore.

1206
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:54,850
You wanted to kill Xiaoheizi.

1207
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:56,331
I understand.

1208
01:08:57,813 --> 01:09:00,152
You and Jia Rui want to pay
allegiance to the Song Dynasty.

1209
01:09:00,176 --> 01:09:01,217
I understand too.

1210
01:09:02,298 --> 01:09:05,061
But now that these guys
risked their lives to follow me,

1211
01:09:05,901 --> 01:09:06,760
I can't

1212
01:09:06,784 --> 01:09:08,344
let them down.

1213
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:11,947
So, will you make yourself a king?

1214
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,148
Exactly.

1215
01:09:13,710 --> 01:09:15,391
Even if I don't conquer Zichuan,

1216
01:09:15,752 --> 01:09:17,233
the Jin army can do nothing about me.

1217
01:09:18,194 --> 01:09:19,371
I want to let my bros

1218
01:09:19,395 --> 01:09:20,836
live a good life.

1219
01:09:35,851 --> 01:09:36,932
A good life?

1220
01:09:39,656 --> 01:09:40,656
A good life.

1221
01:09:42,898 --> 01:09:43,898
Geng Jing,

1222
01:09:44,821 --> 01:09:46,382
do you know what a good life is like?

1223
01:09:47,943 --> 01:09:49,985
Do you know how beautiful

1224
01:09:50,747 --> 01:09:52,187
the scenery in the Song Dynasty was?

1225
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:55,671
Open your eyes wide and look carefully.

1226
01:09:56,512 --> 01:09:58,874
What a mess it has become!

1227
01:10:00,316 --> 01:10:01,758
What is a good life like?

1228
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:04,119
Eating meat?

1229
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:05,880
Drinking alcohol?

1230
01:10:11,927 --> 01:10:13,329
We're homeless.

1231
01:10:13,969 --> 01:10:15,451
How could we live a good life?

1232
01:10:18,534 --> 01:10:19,534
Mr. Geng,

1233
01:10:19,776 --> 01:10:21,417
I've never wanted to fight.

1234
01:10:21,898 --> 01:10:23,419
I don't want to fight at all.

1235
01:10:25,061 --> 01:10:26,061
But there is something.

1236
01:10:27,023 --> 01:10:28,144
I have to do.

1237
01:10:29,105 --> 01:10:30,586
If I'm still alive tomorrow,

1238
01:10:31,828 --> 01:10:33,149
I'll go to Lin'an.

1239
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:35,030
If you want to kill me,

1240
01:10:35,712 --> 01:10:37,312
you don't need to order them to do that.

1241
01:10:39,676 --> 01:10:41,317
Take it.

1242
01:10:42,518 --> 01:10:43,518
My life

1243
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:45,560
is up to you.

1244
01:10:56,372 --> 01:10:57,894
300 cities.

1245
01:11:00,376 --> 01:11:01,978
300 cities.

1246
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:14,329
Bro,

1247
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:17,093
will we come back after
going to the Song Dynasty?

1248
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:22,337
We will.

1249
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:25,380
We'll be back.

1250
01:12:40,837 --> 01:12:41,837
You'an.

1251
01:12:42,598 --> 01:12:43,598
You'an.

1252
01:12:45,161 --> 01:12:46,242
You'an.

1253
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:47,403
Jia,

1254
01:12:47,683 --> 01:12:48,683
why are you here?

1255
01:12:49,725 --> 01:12:50,343
Take it.

1256
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:52,007
The commander asked me to give it to you.

1257
01:12:55,531 --> 01:12:56,531
He said

1258
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:57,293
he'd wait for you to come back

1259
01:12:57,533 --> 01:12:58,533
and we'd

1260
01:12:58,815 --> 01:12:59,815
conquer Zichuan together.

1261
01:13:00,056 --> 01:13:01,056
Okay.

1262
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,704
Mr. Geng, wait for me to come back.

1263
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:17,473
Bro, I wish you a safe journey.

1264
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,398
Bro,

1265
01:13:26,482 --> 01:13:27,482
I did it wrong.

1266
01:13:36,132 --> 01:13:38,094
Go. Let's go back to Tai'an.

1267
01:13:48,264 --> 01:13:52,228
Lin'an City.

1268
01:14:06,883 --> 01:14:09,325
Everything is clearly
written in the memorial.

1269
01:14:09,565 --> 01:14:10,565
Dear all,

1270
01:14:10,967 --> 01:14:12,448
as for the northern expedition,

1271
01:14:12,688 --> 01:14:13,930
what's your opinion?

1272
01:14:17,533 --> 01:14:18,533
Your Majesty,

1273
01:14:18,854 --> 01:14:21,177
this issue is critical to
the fate of our country.

1274
01:14:21,617 --> 01:14:23,739
I don't think we should act rashly.

1275
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:24,878
Besides,

1276
01:14:24,902 --> 01:14:28,264
Xin Qiji and Geng Jing conquered cities,

1277
01:14:28,584 --> 01:14:30,266
but they're just a disorderly mob.

1278
01:14:32,588 --> 01:14:33,588
Your Majesty,

1279
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:35,591
I don't agree with Mr. Lu.

1280
01:14:35,992 --> 01:14:37,633
I'm a rough-neck,

1281
01:14:38,034 --> 01:14:41,437
but I've read articles written by Xin Qiji.

1282
01:14:41,797 --> 01:14:43,198
His ideas about military strategies

1283
01:14:43,719 --> 01:14:45,081
are insightful, indeed.

1284
01:14:45,601 --> 01:14:46,601
What's more,

1285
01:14:46,923 --> 01:14:49,245
I've heard Xin Qiji

1286
01:14:49,445 --> 01:14:50,526
conquered three more cities

1287
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:53,689
after attacking the enemy
at Sifengzha and Tai'an.

1288
01:14:54,450 --> 01:14:56,748
And he defeated enemy troops
with a force inferior in number.

1289
01:14:56,772 --> 01:14:58,094
Words are but wind,

1290
01:14:58,454 --> 01:14:59,535
but seeing is believing.

1291
01:15:00,536 --> 01:15:03,179
I've even heard Xin Qiji

1292
01:15:03,419 --> 01:15:06,742
can fly into the sky and he's
strong enough to lift a big tripod.

1293
01:15:08,344 --> 01:15:09,465
It's just rumor.

1294
01:15:10,146 --> 01:15:11,507
It can't be trusted.

1295
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:13,029
Okay. Seeing is believing.

1296
01:15:15,271 --> 01:15:16,271
Your Majesty,

1297
01:15:16,472 --> 01:15:18,874
Xin Qiji is waiting outside the hall.

1298
01:15:19,235 --> 01:15:20,476
How about letting him come in

1299
01:15:20,756 --> 01:15:22,918
and asking him about it?

1300
01:15:23,839 --> 01:15:24,839
It's permitted.

1301
01:15:26,362 --> 01:15:29,325
Ask Xin Qiji to come in.

1302
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:45,757
Your servant Xin Qiji

1303
01:15:45,781 --> 01:15:47,101
kowtows upon seeing Your Majesty.

1304
01:15:48,624 --> 01:15:49,225
Rise.

1305
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:50,666
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1306
01:15:56,632 --> 01:15:58,034
Are you Xin Qiji?

1307
01:15:59,355 --> 01:16:02,558
Compared with the so-called
long-toothed man with a livid face,

1308
01:16:02,918 --> 01:16:04,760
you're more handsome.

1309
01:16:05,121 --> 01:16:05,841
Your Majesty,

1310
01:16:06,122 --> 01:16:07,619
I can't leap onto roofs or vault over walls

1311
01:16:07,643 --> 01:16:08,860
and I can't lift a big tripod.

1312
01:16:08,884 --> 01:16:11,287
I'm just a common civilian of the Song.

1313
01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:14,730
Well said.

1314
01:16:15,491 --> 01:16:18,614
If every civilian of the Song is like you,

1315
01:16:19,495 --> 01:16:21,777
we must've reclaimed the lost land.

1316
01:16:22,898 --> 01:16:23,898
Your Majesty,

1317
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:24,957
in the territory of Shandong,

1318
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:26,782
there are numerous civilians like me

1319
01:16:26,942 --> 01:16:28,040
who are willing to die on the battle field.

1320
01:16:28,064 --> 01:16:29,465
They will fight to the end

1321
01:16:29,625 --> 01:16:30,642
to drive the Jin army off.

1322
01:16:30,666 --> 01:16:32,364
Nowadays, they've conquered Tai'an,

1323
01:16:32,388 --> 01:16:34,686
Sishui, Yanzhou and Ji'nan.

1324
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:36,088
When you send the army
for the northern expedition,

1325
01:16:36,112 --> 01:16:37,809
they'll risk their lives to conquer Zichuan

1326
01:16:37,833 --> 01:16:38,970
and then cooperate with your army

1327
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:41,397
to wipe out Wanyan Basu's troops.

1328
01:16:41,677 --> 01:16:42,677
Xin Qiji,

1329
01:16:42,758 --> 01:16:44,216
do you think you can persuade His Majesty

1330
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:46,242
just by making empty promises?

1331
01:16:46,642 --> 01:16:49,565
You deserve to be cut to pieces if
the northern expedition is a failure.

1332
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:56,370
There is nothing to fear about death.

1333
01:16:56,532 --> 01:16:57,532
Do you know

1334
01:16:57,653 --> 01:16:58,790
how many people in the Central Plain

1335
01:16:58,814 --> 01:17:00,576
became destitute and homeless?

1336
01:17:00,936 --> 01:17:01,537
Do you know

1337
01:17:01,737 --> 01:17:04,596
how many people lost their lives
to come back to the Song territory?

1338
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:05,620
Do you know

1339
01:17:06,382 --> 01:17:07,382
the voluntter army

1340
01:17:07,663 --> 01:17:09,441
was supposed to live in
peace and contentment

1341
01:17:09,465 --> 01:17:10,465
like people in Lin'an?

1342
01:17:11,067 --> 01:17:14,550
They want to live a good life too.

1343
01:17:17,593 --> 01:17:18,593
If I can

1344
01:17:18,754 --> 01:17:21,253
promote the reunification
of our motherland,

1345
01:17:21,277 --> 01:17:23,014
I won't be afraid

1346
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:24,296
even if I have to die 100 or 1,000 times.

1347
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,320
I will

1348
01:17:25,401 --> 01:17:26,442
die with satisfaction.

1349
01:17:27,323 --> 01:17:28,323
Great!

1350
01:17:32,528 --> 01:17:35,491
The reunification of our motherland.

1351
01:17:37,333 --> 01:17:38,654
Well said.

1352
01:17:39,495 --> 01:17:39,895
Your request

1353
01:17:40,256 --> 01:17:41,256
is permitted!

1354
01:17:45,821 --> 01:17:46,942
Xin Qiji.

1355
01:17:50,146 --> 01:17:51,267
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1356
01:17:51,707 --> 01:17:55,711
May Your Majesty live
for ten thousand years!

1357
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:05,761
West Lake

1358
01:18:05,801 --> 01:18:06,801
Mr. Fangweng.

1359
01:18:07,123 --> 01:18:08,844
You'an, don't call me like that.

1360
01:18:09,125 --> 01:18:10,806
We think alike.

1361
01:18:11,046 --> 01:18:12,984
We're both concerned
about our country and people.

1362
01:18:13,008 --> 01:18:15,090
His Majesty has permitted my request.

1363
01:18:16,212 --> 01:18:17,253
Thank you for your help.

1364
01:18:18,374 --> 01:18:20,576
The saying goes most heroes are youngsters.

1365
01:18:20,936 --> 01:18:22,258
It's true for Huo Qubing

1366
01:18:22,498 --> 01:18:25,341
and for you.

1367
01:18:28,784 --> 01:18:30,322
Langtou, let's go back to Tai'an!

1368
01:18:30,346 --> 01:18:31,683
Time to go back to Tai'an.

1369
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:32,707
Let's go back to Tai'an.

1370
01:18:42,398 --> 01:18:44,880
Bros, open the city gate.

1371
01:18:45,161 --> 01:18:46,602
We're back!

1372
01:18:50,686 --> 01:18:53,689
Guys, general secretary is back!

1373
01:18:55,651 --> 01:18:57,453
Bro, let me knock at the gate.

1374
01:18:57,653 --> 01:18:58,653
Okay.

1375
01:19:03,339 --> 01:19:07,503
Bros, open the city gate. We're back!

1376
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:12,188
Bros, general secretary is back!

1377
01:19:13,028 --> 01:19:14,028
General secretary.

1378
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:15,149
General secretary.

1379
01:19:15,311 --> 01:19:16,352
General secretary is back.

1380
01:19:16,792 --> 01:19:17,953
General secretary is back!

1381
01:19:29,285 --> 01:19:30,366
Mr. Xin!

1382
01:19:31,927 --> 01:19:34,610
Mr. Xin, you're finally back!

1383
01:19:40,736 --> 01:19:41,736
Back off.

1384
01:19:57,553 --> 01:19:58,553
You're back.

1385
01:19:59,355 --> 01:20:01,397
Yeah. I'm back.

1386
01:20:02,998 --> 01:20:04,320
Say goodbye to our commander.

1387
01:21:52,147 --> 01:21:52,508
Father,

1388
01:21:53,148 --> 01:21:54,950
our scout reported that Geng Jing is dead.

1389
01:22:08,444 --> 01:22:09,605
Zhang Anguo,

1390
01:22:16,452 --> 01:22:19,495
you achieved notable merits this time.

1391
01:22:19,775 --> 01:22:23,178
Just let me know what you want as reward.

1392
01:22:27,823 --> 01:22:29,144
I want nothing.

1393
01:22:30,105 --> 01:22:32,388
I just want to do all I can to serve you.

1394
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:35,870
Good.

1395
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:38,514
Those who suit their
actions to the times are wise.

1396
01:22:38,794 --> 01:22:41,837
I'll leave Yanzhou City in your control.

1397
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:46,802
I'll hold an investiture for you
on the drill ground tomorrow.

1398
01:22:47,683 --> 01:22:49,643
Thank you for your great
kindness, Your Highness.

1399
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:51,286
I'll remember it for life.

1400
01:22:51,647 --> 01:22:52,647
You can leave.

1401
01:22:52,728 --> 01:22:53,728
Got it.

1402
01:22:54,089 --> 01:22:55,089
Hold on.

1403
01:22:56,211 --> 01:22:59,174
This maid is yours too.

1404
01:23:03,499 --> 01:23:04,499
Thank you, Your Highness.

1405
01:23:12,147 --> 01:23:13,147
Father,

1406
01:23:13,629 --> 01:23:15,630
You leave Yanzhou to him.
Can you rest your heart?

1407
01:23:16,632 --> 01:23:17,912
He even dared to kill Geng Jing.

1408
01:23:18,113 --> 01:23:19,354
He's not trustworthy.

1409
01:23:19,955 --> 01:23:21,797
He's just a pawn.

1410
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:23,198
Don't worry.

1411
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:28,604
By doing this, I want
to let those rebels know

1412
01:23:28,924 --> 01:23:32,207
the only way out for
them is to surrender to us.

1413
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:42,416
Shuanghua.

1414
01:23:49,304 --> 01:23:50,304
Shuanghua,

1415
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:53,749
Xin has stayed inside for a day.

1416
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:55,831
I'm worried about him.

1417
01:23:56,351 --> 01:23:57,351
He's grieving.

1418
01:23:57,913 --> 01:23:59,114
We'd better leave him alone.

1419
01:24:11,206 --> 01:24:12,206
That day,

1420
01:24:13,889 --> 01:24:15,370
Geng was very happy.

1421
01:24:17,813 --> 01:24:20,135
He got all the alcohol
in the city moved out.

1422
01:24:22,297 --> 01:24:23,539
Everyone got drunk,

1423
01:24:25,501 --> 01:24:26,502
so did he.

1424
01:24:28,784 --> 01:24:29,784
He said

1425
01:24:31,747 --> 01:24:33,789
he'd never fight again

1426
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:36,311
after we conquer Zichuan.

1427
01:24:38,393 --> 01:24:39,394
Unexpectedly,

1428
01:24:41,036 --> 01:24:46,241
Zhang Anguo killed him while he got drunk.

1429
01:24:48,483 --> 01:24:51,807
Jia, am I wrong?

1430
01:24:57,372 --> 01:24:59,054
When I just came to Tai'an,

1431
01:25:00,335 --> 01:25:02,217
I felt hopeless about life.

1432
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:04,499
But since I met you,

1433
01:25:05,781 --> 01:25:07,381
I feel like I've got my enthusiasm back.

1434
01:25:09,625 --> 01:25:10,906
Geng also said

1435
01:25:12,668 --> 01:25:15,350
a man can't live without hope.

1436
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:18,312
It's you

1437
01:25:19,234 --> 01:25:20,636
that brought us hope.

1438
01:25:22,277 --> 01:25:24,079
But I let him lose his life.

1439
01:25:25,881 --> 01:25:26,881
Xiaoheizi,

1440
01:25:29,284 --> 01:25:30,284
Liang,

1441
01:25:31,206 --> 01:25:33,088
and all bros at Sifengzha and Tai'an

1442
01:25:34,529 --> 01:25:36,251
just wanted to survive

1443
01:25:38,413 --> 01:25:39,694
and find a way to make a living.

1444
01:25:41,416 --> 01:25:42,898
In the troubled times,

1445
01:25:43,538 --> 01:25:45,500
it's not easy to survive.

1446
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:48,542
Now that Geng is dead,

1447
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:51,304
everyone in Tai'an has lost
morale and many have left.

1448
01:25:52,788 --> 01:25:54,189
When the funeral is finished,

1449
01:25:54,830 --> 01:25:57,072
I'll take the rest of the army to the Song.

1450
01:25:58,553 --> 01:26:00,315
Geng would do that if he were alive.

1451
01:26:10,405 --> 01:26:11,405
You'an,

1452
01:26:11,486 --> 01:26:12,608
as long as we have hope,

1453
01:26:13,488 --> 01:26:14,488
we can

1454
01:26:14,930 --> 01:26:16,451
recover the lost land.

1455
01:26:18,694 --> 01:26:19,814
I'll wait for you in Lin'an.

1456
01:27:09,825 --> 01:27:10,825
Xin Qiji,

1457
01:27:10,946 --> 01:27:12,403
are you going to leave like that?

1458
01:27:12,427 --> 01:27:12,964
Shuanghua.

1459
01:27:12,988 --> 01:27:13,988
You asshole!

1460
01:27:16,511 --> 01:27:18,153
Zhang Anguo killed Geng.

1461
01:27:18,914 --> 01:27:20,115
I have to go to the Jin camp

1462
01:27:20,395 --> 01:27:21,515
and take him back to Lin'an.

1463
01:27:22,317 --> 01:27:24,558
Only by telling everyone
what a traitor will end up with

1464
01:27:24,760 --> 01:27:26,080
can I get the army's morale back.

1465
01:27:26,441 --> 01:27:27,441
And only in this way

1466
01:27:28,083 --> 01:27:29,484
will I be worthy of Geng's trust.

1467
01:27:30,565 --> 01:27:31,565
In this life,

1468
01:27:31,887 --> 01:27:32,887
no matter where you go,

1469
01:27:33,328 --> 01:27:34,186
even if it's the remotest
corners of the globe,

1470
01:27:34,210 --> 01:27:35,490
I won't let you leave me behind.

1471
01:27:35,931 --> 01:27:36,972
Never ever!

1472
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:46,420
Bro,

1473
01:27:46,621 --> 01:27:48,343
it's you that saved my life.

1474
01:27:48,704 --> 01:27:49,705
How can you

1475
01:27:50,025 --> 01:27:51,466
go to the enemy's camp without me?

1476
01:27:53,068 --> 01:27:53,806
Zhang Anguo is an animal.

1477
01:27:53,830 --> 01:27:55,390
He's been offensive to the eye.

1478
01:27:55,831 --> 01:27:57,208
If you want to avenge Geng's death,

1479
01:27:57,232 --> 01:27:58,232
count me in.

1480
01:27:58,353 --> 01:27:59,474
Count me in!

1481
01:28:21,056 --> 01:28:22,096
I'd travelled around China

1482
01:28:22,417 --> 01:28:24,539
with my grandpa since childhood.

1483
01:28:25,220 --> 01:28:26,620
I praise myself for my achievements

1484
01:28:26,862 --> 01:28:28,142
and aspire to recover lost land.

1485
01:28:29,224 --> 01:28:30,224
You rose up with me

1486
01:28:30,545 --> 01:28:32,307
at Sifengzha

1487
01:28:32,988 --> 01:28:33,988
and then came to Tai'an

1488
01:28:34,269 --> 01:28:35,470
to fight against the Jin army.

1489
01:28:36,071 --> 01:28:38,673
His Majesty named us Taiping Army

1490
01:28:39,394 --> 01:28:41,394
and Mr. Geng was appointed
as provincial governor.

1491
01:28:43,198 --> 01:28:44,198
But nowadays,

1492
01:28:44,599 --> 01:28:45,961
Zhang Anguo betrayed us

1493
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:47,963
and killed Mr. Geng.

1494
01:28:52,287 --> 01:28:53,448
I have to get rid of him,

1495
01:28:53,849 --> 01:28:54,826
or I don't deserve

1496
01:28:54,850 --> 01:28:56,291
to be a man of the Song.

1497
01:28:56,892 --> 01:28:58,109
Everyone, attention!

1498
01:28:58,133 --> 01:28:58,991
Yes, sir!

1499
01:28:59,015 --> 01:29:00,431
Fight your way through the Jin camp with me

1500
01:29:00,455 --> 01:29:02,457
and catch the traitor Zhang Anguo.

1501
01:29:58,553 --> 01:30:00,371
Father, the main forces
have set off to the south.

1502
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:01,796
The rest has assembled.

1503
01:30:04,119 --> 01:30:05,440
When things get done,

1504
01:30:06,361 --> 01:30:07,883
we should set off.

1505
01:30:16,211 --> 01:30:17,853
Warriors of the Jin Dynasty,

1506
01:30:19,214 --> 01:30:22,057
you're going to the south with me

1507
01:30:23,218 --> 01:30:25,700
for the expedition.

1508
01:30:26,381 --> 01:30:29,384
We'll conquer

1509
01:30:30,105 --> 01:30:31,786
those weak Song people

1510
01:30:32,347 --> 01:30:34,205
and keep the flag of the Jin flying

1511
01:30:34,229 --> 01:30:36,992
everywhere we arrive.

1512
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:41,036
You will witness

1513
01:30:41,356 --> 01:30:44,159
the honorable moments with me!

1514
01:30:46,241 --> 01:30:47,241
Long live

1515
01:30:48,363 --> 01:30:49,660
the Jin!

1516
01:30:49,684 --> 01:30:50,781
Long live!

1517
01:30:50,805 --> 01:30:51,782
Long live!

1518
01:30:51,806 --> 01:30:52,944
Long live!

1519
01:30:52,968 --> 01:30:53,945
Long live!

1520
01:30:53,969 --> 01:30:55,066
Long live!

1521
01:30:55,090 --> 01:30:56,411
Long live!

1522
01:30:58,934 --> 01:30:59,934
Mei'er.

1523
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:06,581
Take Zhang Anguo the
surrendered enemy general here.

1524
01:31:16,311 --> 01:31:17,512
Your servant Zhang Anguo

1525
01:31:18,393 --> 01:31:19,834
is willing to surrender to the Jin.

1526
01:31:20,355 --> 01:31:21,556
I'll be always loyal to you.

1527
01:31:23,118 --> 01:31:25,080
The surrender ceremony begins.

1528
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:28,323
The surrender ceremony begins!

1529
01:31:46,381 --> 01:31:50,425
Long live the Jin!

1530
01:31:54,349 --> 01:31:57,953
Zhang Anguo, from now on,

1531
01:31:58,433 --> 01:32:00,195
you'll be an official of the Jin.

1532
01:32:01,916 --> 01:32:03,037
I'll leave the official seal

1533
01:32:03,758 --> 01:32:05,096
to you.

1534
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:07,522
Thank you, Your Highness.

1535
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:26,260
From now on,

1536
01:32:26,461 --> 01:32:29,104
you have to work hard to serve the Jin.

1537
01:32:29,664 --> 01:32:30,664
Remember.

1538
01:32:31,266 --> 01:32:33,844
You exchanged your bro's life for it.

1539
01:32:33,868 --> 01:32:34,868
I see.

1540
01:32:34,990 --> 01:32:35,990
I see.

1541
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:57,612
Go!

1542
01:33:04,459 --> 01:33:05,556
Enemy strike.

1543
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:06,797
Enemy strike.

1544
01:33:06,821 --> 01:33:08,023
Enemy strike.

1545
01:33:18,873 --> 01:33:19,873
Bros,

1546
01:33:19,994 --> 01:33:21,356
pull back!

1547
01:34:24,779 --> 01:34:25,779
Zhang Anguo.

1548
01:35:01,416 --> 01:35:02,416
Capture him alive.

1549
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:03,697
Got it.

1550
01:35:40,175 --> 01:35:41,071
Don't let Zhang Anguo run away.

1551
01:35:41,095 --> 01:35:41,656
Be careful.

1552
01:35:41,936 --> 01:35:42,936
Got it.

1553
01:36:32,587 --> 01:36:33,124
It's the Jin.

1554
01:36:33,148 --> 01:36:34,949
It's the Jin that asked me to do that.

1555
01:36:35,870 --> 01:36:36,431
Mr. Xin,

1556
01:36:36,671 --> 01:36:38,072
please give me one more chance.

1557
01:36:38,553 --> 01:36:39,930
Let's go out

1558
01:36:39,954 --> 01:36:41,876
and kill all of them.

1559
01:36:50,725 --> 01:36:54,048
Xin Qiji, don't go too far in bullying me.

1560
01:36:54,609 --> 01:36:57,228
Zhang Anguo, have you thought about this

1561
01:36:57,252 --> 01:36:58,653
when you killed Geng?

1562
01:36:58,853 --> 01:37:00,094
He deserved it!

1563
01:37:01,576 --> 01:37:03,217
I followed him for so many years.

1564
01:37:03,658 --> 01:37:05,179
I risked my life for his sake

1565
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:06,821
and fought nearly 100 battles.

1566
01:37:07,662 --> 01:37:09,504
But when you arrived, I finally understood.

1567
01:37:10,024 --> 01:37:13,067
I'm just a pawn in his mind!

1568
01:37:15,109 --> 01:37:16,391
He deserved it.

1569
01:37:16,671 --> 01:37:18,393
All of you deserve death!

1570
01:37:20,755 --> 01:37:23,133
You acted in bad faith and killed Geng,

1571
01:37:23,157 --> 01:37:24,295
which makes you deserve death.

1572
01:37:24,319 --> 01:37:26,056
You surrendered to the
Jin for money and power,

1573
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,281
which makes you deserve death.

1574
01:37:27,322 --> 01:37:28,539
The northern expedition of the Song

1575
01:37:28,563 --> 01:37:30,764
suffered defeat on the verge
of victory because of you.

1576
01:37:31,045 --> 01:37:32,863
Zhang Anguo, you're an unfaithful,

1577
01:37:32,887 --> 01:37:34,929
untrustworthy and heartless brute!

1578
01:37:51,906 --> 01:37:52,906
Go!

1579
01:38:16,371 --> 01:38:17,932
Your Highness, help me!

1580
01:38:19,734 --> 01:38:21,094
You did all this to take him back.

1581
01:38:21,175 --> 01:38:22,175
Is it worth it?

1582
01:38:22,417 --> 01:38:23,417
Xin Qiji,

1583
01:38:23,778 --> 01:38:25,195
I used to be a friend

1584
01:38:25,219 --> 01:38:26,501
of your grandpa.

1585
01:38:26,981 --> 01:38:28,823
Today, I'll give you one more chance.

1586
01:38:29,263 --> 01:38:30,425
As long as you give in,

1587
01:38:30,825 --> 01:38:31,906
I'll spare your life.

1588
01:38:32,146 --> 01:38:33,267
I also promise

1589
01:38:33,588 --> 01:38:36,030
you'll have a promising future.

1590
01:38:38,673 --> 01:38:40,114
A promising future?

1591
01:38:42,357 --> 01:38:43,357
Wanyan Basu,

1592
01:38:43,958 --> 01:38:45,400
I'll also give you a chance.

1593
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,177
As long as you get
out of the Song territory

1594
01:38:47,201 --> 01:38:48,483
with all the other Jin people,

1595
01:38:48,883 --> 01:38:51,462
I'll spare your life.

1596
01:38:51,486 --> 01:38:52,103
Get out of here!

1597
01:38:52,127 --> 01:38:53,928
Get out of here!

1598
01:38:54,689 --> 01:38:56,531
Your arrogant jerk.

1599
01:39:02,537 --> 01:39:03,537
Shuanghua,

1600
01:39:04,178 --> 01:39:05,178
marry me.

1601
01:39:08,543 --> 01:39:09,543
Okay.

1602
01:40:27,822 --> 01:40:28,822
Shuanghua.

1603
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:46,200
You'an.

1604
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:46,921
I'm here.

1605
01:40:47,361 --> 01:40:47,762
I'm here.

1606
01:40:48,122 --> 01:40:49,122
I'm here.

1607
01:40:51,606 --> 01:40:52,606
Shuanghua.

1608
01:40:58,693 --> 01:40:59,693
You'an.

1609
01:41:08,943 --> 01:41:09,944
Shuanghua.

1610
01:41:42,937 --> 01:41:45,499
Wanyan Basu!

1611
01:42:09,804 --> 01:42:10,965
Stop him!

1612
01:42:34,789 --> 01:42:35,789
Hurry.

1613
01:43:11,666 --> 01:43:12,666
Bro.

1614
01:43:12,827 --> 01:43:13,827
Get on!

1615
01:43:37,451 --> 01:43:38,933
Bro,

1616
01:43:39,613 --> 01:43:40,613
in the next life,

1617
01:43:41,335 --> 01:43:44,338
I'll still be your bro.

1618
01:44:19,814 --> 01:44:22,380
Xin Qiji took the traitor Zhang Anguo
back to Lin'an and had him decapitated

1619
01:44:22,404 --> 01:44:24,995
as a human sacrifice to Geng Jing, Li
Shuanghua, Langtou and other soldiers.

1620
01:44:25,019 --> 01:44:26,994
As the news spread to the
Central Plain, the morale of the

1621
01:44:27,018 --> 01:44:28,949
volunteer army in different
places was improved greatly.

1622
01:44:28,973 --> 01:44:30,970
They fought battles against
the Jin army again and

1623
01:44:30,994 --> 01:44:33,213
again and eventually made
the Jin's invasion a failure.

1624
01:45:18,432 --> 01:45:20,394
When all at once I turn my head,

1625
01:45:22,156 --> 01:45:23,998
I find her there

1626
01:45:24,238 --> 01:45:26,801
where lantern light is dimly shed.

1627
01:46:00,634 --> 01:46:02,276
When all at once I turn my head,

1628
01:46:03,477 --> 01:46:04,999
I find her there

1629
01:46:05,719 --> 01:46:07,441
where lantern light is dimly shed.

1630
01:46:08,082 --> 01:46:11,261
This film is dedicated to
heroes in all dynasties that

1631
01:46:11,285 --> 01:46:14,488
kept fighting for the
country's territorial integrity!

1632
01:46:40,354 --> 01:46:42,100
That year, a series of
rituals were conducted at the.

1633
01:46:42,124 --> 01:46:43,894
Khentii Mountains to
symbolize the historic victory.

1634
01:46:43,918 --> 01:46:47,041
Bearing the country in his mind, he
swept forward from victory to victory.

1635
01:46:47,281 --> 01:46:50,444
Submitting requests for a military
assignment, the hero wiped away his tears.

1636
01:46:50,644 --> 01:46:55,049
Holding a halberd in his hand, he
carried out maneuvers in the field.

1637
01:46:55,809 --> 01:46:59,069
With soaring aspirations, he had slain
the foe on the thousand-mile Central Plain.

1638
01:46:59,093 --> 01:47:02,552
He hadn't fulfilled his ambition and
mortal life endured but a few autumns.

1639
01:47:02,576 --> 01:47:05,916
Though drunk, he lit the
lamp to see the glaive.

1640
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:12,266
Who knows his
righteousness and brave heart?

1641
01:47:13,347 --> 01:47:16,887
The land is boundless as of
yore. With literary and military skills,

1642
01:47:16,911 --> 01:47:19,769
he never changed his mind to
resist the enemy till his death.

1643
01:47:19,793 --> 01:47:23,453
Look at the singing hall, the
dancing ground and the grassy lane.

1644
01:47:23,477 --> 01:47:26,897
When would the lost land be retaken?

1645
01:47:26,921 --> 01:47:30,340
Through flurries and
squalls, the land was broken.

1646
01:47:30,364 --> 01:47:33,503
Pale-faced and grey-haired,
he still wanted to do his best,

1647
01:47:33,527 --> 01:47:37,227
with twanging bows and a sharp knife.

1648
01:47:37,251 --> 01:47:44,114
Waking up from a drunken dream,
he left many famous ci poems.

1649
01:47:44,138 --> 01:47:49,559
On gallant steed, running full speed,

1650
01:47:49,583 --> 01:47:55,029
we'd shoot with twanging bows.

1651
01:47:55,269 --> 01:48:00,210
Recovering the lost land for the sovereign,

1652
01:48:00,234 --> 01:48:06,640
this everlasting fame that we would win.

1653
01:48:23,217 --> 01:48:24,842
That year, a series of
rituals were conducted at the.

1654
01:48:24,866 --> 01:48:26,516
Khentii Mountains to
symbolize the historic victory.

1655
01:48:26,540 --> 01:48:29,960
Bearing the country in his mind, he
swept forward from victory to victory.

1656
01:48:29,984 --> 01:48:33,323
Submitting requests for a military
assignment, the hero wiped away his tears.

1657
01:48:33,347 --> 01:48:37,831
Holding a halberd in his hand, he
carried out maneuvers in the field.

1658
01:48:38,432 --> 01:48:42,012
With soaring aspirations, he had slain
the foe on the thousand-mile Central Plain.

1659
01:48:42,036 --> 01:48:45,255
He hadn't fulfilled his ambition and
mortal life endured but a few autumns.

1660
01:48:45,279 --> 01:48:48,738
Though drunk, he lit the
lamp to see the glaive.

1661
01:48:48,762 --> 01:48:55,049
Who knows his
righteousness and brave heart?

1662
01:48:56,170 --> 01:48:59,669
The land is boundless as of
yore. With literary and military skills,

1663
01:48:59,693 --> 01:49:02,712
he never changed his mind to
resist the enemy till his death.

1664
01:49:02,736 --> 01:49:06,236
Look at the singing hall, the
dancing ground and the grassy lane.

1665
01:49:06,260 --> 01:49:09,839
When would the lost land be retaken?

1666
01:49:09,863 --> 01:49:13,163
Through flurries and
squalls, the land was broken.

1667
01:49:13,187 --> 01:49:16,886
Pale-faced and grey-haired,
he still wanted to do his best,

1668
01:49:16,910 --> 01:49:20,010
with twanging bows and a sharp knife.

1669
01:49:20,034 --> 01:49:26,977
Waking up from a drunken dream,
he left many famous ci poems.

1670
01:49:27,001 --> 01:49:32,166
Since thwarted in his plan
to recover the lost land,

1671
01:49:32,446 --> 01:49:37,947
he learned from neighbors
how to plant fruit trees by hand.

1672
01:49:37,971 --> 01:49:42,912
The beauty has spent a
thousand for Xiangru's poem,

1673
01:49:42,936 --> 01:49:49,679
but the monarch seemed
to have a hear of stone.

1674
01:49:49,703 --> 01:49:53,283
The land is boundless as of
yore. With literary and military skills,

1675
01:49:53,307 --> 01:49:56,246
he never changed his mind to
resist the enemy till his death.

1676
01:49:56,270 --> 01:49:59,969
Look at the singing hall, the
dancing ground and the grassy lane.

1677
01:49:59,993 --> 01:50:03,333
When would the lost land be retaken?

1678
01:50:03,357 --> 01:50:06,656
Through flurries and
squalls, the land was broken.

1679
01:50:06,680 --> 01:50:09,939
Pale-faced and grey-haired,
he still wanted to do his best,

1680
01:50:09,963 --> 01:50:13,583
with twanging bows and a sharp knife.

1681
01:50:13,607 --> 01:50:20,094
Waking up from a drunken dream,
he left many famous ci poems.

1682
01:50:20,734 --> 01:50:28,734
Waking up from a drunken dream,
he left many famous ci poems.
